THUNDER ABOVE LLANBERIS
The lens of the sky
bulges with tension; is stretched
impossibly like hot cling film.
Horizons blur and slow.
The afternoon
is slipping under, into coma.
We climb in silence, loose slate
betraying us like blind men's steps.
Even our legs are unwilling
as if it is not natural not to stand
like the sheep, and submit.
There is a heaviness of words not said
between us, dragging us higher
though the air is a stale warm pond
that seems to want to smother us
as the heaps of dull gouged rock
starey with resentment, try to drown
the rowans' demonstrated green
and the thick shorn fleeces
of the hawthorn.
Nothing moves
but us; no bees.
no summer flies.
Traffic and the small train
braying to the tourists in the valley
are a world away
from this leashed awareness
that is soaking up
all scent, all purpose.
Thunder
stalks and rumbles, a Doberman
afraid of its own temper.
We hear it throttled into silence 
and we too hold our breath and push a way
into the gloom of a deep-quarried pit
filling up with growth, whose walls
close round us like petals
and they are not even walls
but wounds.
The storm is nearer now
too near.
Air cries
out in an anguish sharp as cracking bones
thickening the clot of fear
in throat and belly, unscrewing forty years
to a small dark cupboard
under stairs — and, at last 
right overhead, the sky
splits open, and we see the white
heat flicker and pulse
behind its great ripped lid.
The leaves are metal in the mad
staccato of its blinking, and we turn away
from such searing, such cautery
of jagged edges that the rain
begins to seep from, lukewarm
and luxurious, so
the day we step out into
exhales and whispers to itself
beginning afresh.
PENINSULAR
Like where we are all heading:
away
from the womb-connections
the gradual winding road
leafy cradles and the old volcanoes
at our back.
Side turnings;
stopovers; safe houses.
For a sparer landscape
skies full of signals
brinks and discovered primrose coves
lower, thinning horizons
where distance smooths
the shadow of named places
and air not hazed by heat
or growth-goaded
full only of itself, magnanimous,
offers the taste
of meaning otherwise.
Space and time stretch out
to show us to ourselves
as local examples.
The rhythms and the colours
slow and deepen.
All day
the eye of the sky
bulges, lidless and forgiving
until darkness comes to roost
undisturbed in its lashes.
Weather breaks on us
like waves; cloud-futures
drift.
With dignity
we look on as the fictions of our lives
fall open, shrivel
and with our words are snatched away
to seed the wind.
Here, we move closer to share warmth.
As in a ward, grow gentler
knowing where the road ends
where the land sinks
beyond the island
the embrace of its one safe beach
(earth's last brief easing)
waits for each of us
the whispering loom
of our own ocean.
FLOATING
I had to pass forty
to learn it: to look up at the brightness
and let the clenched self go.
Before, I was too narrow
not trusting the balance of will in my body
not to slip through the spaces
in the skin of the water
the stretched molecules
they swore would buoy me up.
At the sea's edge, turned dense with terror
of sliding into the dark without even screaming
like a stillborn.
Times, we all hear the wind
especially the black throat of the wind in winter
threatening to blow us out,
feel our bodies teased on high places
but I have a pact with salt water
remembering it close over me
so, once, I knew I was starfished somewhere
older than air, feeling the ocean
stroking my throat into trance
soldering rolled-up eyes to the back of my skull
filling me with warm salt
winning me back
and I clung
to the bubble, to come back to the brightness
to be repierced by breath.
Twenty years I spent rooted
in the middle of land, forgetting the time-scale
of elements, keeping track of the caul
my father was born with
that he never needed, his own blood drowned him.
But since metal stiffens
in my hair, and I sag
from the spine with the stretched
weight of guts, I can spread my arms wide
and wait for absorption.
We all know it must happen
as owl fledglings must somehow know
one day they will step off
into dark.
Almost casually
one afternoon, between a yawn
and a tidal swallow, some sea
might take me down.
And I wonder
if my old monkey reflex
does not have me cling too hard
if it might not even be
a grateful merging, like letting mind
and body slide
into the flow of sleep
after making love, that other tiny
melting at the edge
of time.
Brightness must
suck its burnish from the underside,
twin richnesses we strut between
that wait only to fill us in.
TREE WIFE
( "Late wood is a darker circle on the outer side of each tree ring" 
Irmngard Lucht, The Tree Calendar.)
I have been a rich tree-wife all summer
shrugging him close as a second skin
I have grown sleek with love and feeding:
glossy, heartwood rippling with sap
His arms are golden boughs, horse-chestnut-strong.
I have had flowers and fruit from his branches.
I lean against him like the bole of a great tree
and his breath is the wind in my ear
His roots brace mine against earthquakes
yet he sleeps in my arms like the summer sea.
When, chilled by the ocean's brisking
we haul ourselves out, cold runs off him
and his body is a rock I lizard to
warm from the fire at the heart of the world
It is the miraculous barrel that saves me
from the shipwrecking dream
His hands are huge, rectangular, rope-scarred
padded like the inside of a chestnut;
clenched, his knuckles are mesas
but the fingers uncurl into fronds 
that touch gently as pollen.
His palms cradle me in a green cup
But he would be honey, set round me
fill all my emptinesses
and I must be a winter tree
my mind full of spaces
must split, sprout and let go.
Not strength nor sweetness can hold me.
Between Wakings
FREUDIAN
In middle age, I dream a mother
floating steadily downstream
on a well-scrubbed kitchen table.
It is not my mother
but a Fifties cut-out
bridling and jaunty in a flowered wrapover;
it is not even me, nor siblings
(a mix of appropriate ages and genders
four or five of us and Timmy-the-dog)
who run and play along the riverbank
keeping pace with the table
waving as in celebration
high on sunlight and shouting
stamping out reflections in the water-meadows
calling across
the increasing suck and gurgle
as the shining widens and unrolls.
Somewhere beyond, vague as the sky
is a father.
BETWEEN WAKINGS
(for Gillian Clarke)
Begins with moaning in a long hoarse throat:
wind unscraping meaning
from the stones, and the sky
weeping black petals.
I am a numb recording eye
with sound-link-up
in a darkness at the heart of being charred.
Endless, soundless drift, dark blossom-fall
night's whole nest plundered
tide of dry ash rising
on the last lit window in the valley
where a woman, silver-wimpled by her hair
stands and witnesses world-burial.
Behind her in the fluorescent glint
bald heads and napes bulge over armchairs
still turned inwards, turned away.
A lifetime's images of light
drown between her eyes and mine.
Ice-brightness and the rare green flare
of ocean sunsets; lightning's tongues
fields furred under a harvest moon
all the honey-strokes of colour.
A woman poet in a crystal cave.
Silence and sootfall.
A last eye being closed.
I pray to find myself again
between wakings.
4 a.m.
The light that creeps into this room
is white as candlewax and cold.
It coats the sleeping shapes of things;
no sane sister of the dark
crawling in with its smell of wet fur
or old albino moss.
Everything
hushes: breath, even, sides gentler.
If this light that seeps through crack and curtain
were gas or radiation dust
they could not lie more tidily
man and wife so carefully apart
though flexed to face the same wind's quarter.
Their faces glimmer like cooled fat.
Each suspects the other is awake.
Nearby, still whole as flowers,
their children — boy who steered a ship of light
from star to star, girl with pale hair fanned
across her pillow like a princess in a
story — defined again to daytime selves.
The shadows and the sweetnesses of dream
rubbed smooth, almost, as alabaster.
Dawn is a tundra border crossed
helplessly, as on a train.
Grey shapes
of the possible block in round us.
It must be luxury to sleep right through:
to wake and, stretching, know you have,
you are.
DEEP UNDER
Turning out the Tilly lamp
makes our bed a rippling shore
as, mantled at the tideline, light
weakens with each wash of dark
rot will move over her
a charge of blue seed
quivering her thighs, flooding
the bright, packed silks, the slit reefs
prying under fingernails
disentangling white stalks
for the petals to fall free
and alchemise to a stencil.
Then her long bones will be
galleries of sighing
her ribcage a cathedral.
The wings of her shoulders
go on promising horizons, her pelvis
pause at the edge of its double question
the little carpal and the tarsal bones
lie orderly, arranged like pieces
waiting to clatter into prophecy.
The shell of her skull shall brim with honey:
in each eye-cave a chrysalis
stir toward the shrouded sun.
Ladybird and velvet mite and leaf beetle
seedpearls of snails' eggs
nest in the sockets of her knuckles.
In each dry crack, a patient germ:
primrose and birch and rosemary,
white roots of fern to weave a launchpad.
She should be lodged in topmost branches
stirred at the heart of her own green storm
but her smile will shine out
through blinded ground, through deafened wind
because she stayed eager all her life
kept her face to the edge
constantly spending
and was charged with such brightness
waste cannot claim her.
LIKE WAKING
Like waking at the crystal heart
of a geode, one-season-sealed
that time we lay together silent
rapt, in an integument of ice
something relentless already pushing
upwards, outwards, apart
till the animal smell of smoke
fire's quick digestion
roused me and I rose
acrid and glowing like phosphorous
separate, to be shaped, separate;
and as I cooled I could have been
a salmon or a sun-winged eagle
but I was only a gingerbread woman
my face a smudged thumbprint
eyes narrow, black and squinting.
I had thought I might
soar — could only muster a dumpy trundling
and as fast as I could
kept me only ahead of the hungry mouths
until the sun caught sight of me
fixed me in his pulsing lens 
so I twisted and shrivelled.
My body wept beads of treacle.
I burnt with a thin black flame
with a sigh like submission.
A few spasm-scattered crumbs
on the bald brow of the ice
charred insentient grains
wait, like seeds, to be swallowed.
IN WOMEN'S THANATOLOGICAL
Last Night I dreamt death therapy
First, video of a high white room
where a woman lay on a high white bed
lay with hands clasped across her chest
while the thanatician talked her through
a gradual ceasing
of all conscious functions.
We saw her troubled dark eyes close,
the pulses on the monitors crawl slower.
The ticks in gauging just how long
we need to keep you under.
Three days is usually enough.
Doctors, sitting high like magistrates
me the plaintiff in a coarse white gown
(the chairseat cold where tapes had frayed)
husband and son each side of me
in a winter-blinded room.
Wanting me happy, wanting me cured.
We can fill your veins with granite
powdered lobotomise your brain
or shock it till it shrieks no more.
This is the gentler way:
convince the mind the body's dead
and it gives up the ghost.
No more haunting, then; no
presence that disturbs me
no other voices, words-as-strangers
flaring through the hiss of distance…
It kills the soul; that's what you mean.
Two smiled sad tolerance; the third
squared the files, examining
his silver-plated pen, his cold, bleached nails.
We don't think of it in quite those terms.
We've found a tiny offshoot of imagination
that once, like the appendix doubtless had
some useful function.
Now quite obsolete.
Indeed, in most we find it's atrophied.
Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of patients
feel much steadier, less impeded.
For the first time, find what content is.
Hail pattered on the window, quick as morse.
And the others?…
Well, yes — a few
show some reluctance at the calling-back
Need some — further treatment.
But they too settle down again in time.
I began to guess the quality of drifting
in that padded-velvet sleep
beyond all echo of forgetting
a long spell out of even dreaming's shadow
numb and empty as a blown eggshell
and suddenly found myself, with them,
outside on the rush-hour street
where the flecked charcoal of the sky 
made buses, lights and shoppers' faces
glow.
A swirl of starlings
beat the air, and everything about me moaned
or sang, and I still had the sense
to go on listening.
WHALE DREAM
In a dream I loosed my voice
into the echoing vault of the ocean
knowing once it would have stirred an answer
half a world away among the ice.
Slowed and strengthened to cetacean pulse
I swam in the womb of the world
and the stars were a whalespine above me
charged focuses that sang my bearings
and I could read the streams with all the skin
of my glistening long body
and let the breath flow through me in a song
serene but reaching, the refrain of journeys
going on means going far
going far means returning
and as a dolphin sleeps with half of its brain
so half of me knew I was a woman
dreaming a whale; for the rest I seemed
a cetacean's fear of being human
shrivelled back to sharps
and bulges, skin cracked and tight
over jerky bones, skull full of hooks
grinning their way to the light
while I was richly lined and supple,
the water curved me like a lover
stroked at every creaming touch
whirlpools of colour down my flanks.
We smile with our whole bodies
we see where all is dark
we hear where all is still:
water heals itself of spaces
But my singing was a memory of how
nursed deep within the waves' turmoil
in the still heart of flowing
we wove our patterns of shared song
in a language kinder than words
loops and swirls of sense that make words seem
small closed hooks
to button meaning, keep it closed.
In images that shone against the dark
more immediate than tasting
more shifting than pictures
pulsing on the nerves like touch
I was charged with hymns to water, and in praise
of the sun-bred krill; hunting chants of the tribes
who ride an adrenalin frenzy;
Blue Whale meditations
and the Humpback sagas —of the First Men
and the one lost boy;
the heroes of the Hundred Savings
when sea took back the land;
and shared the disappointment of the dolphins
when they first leapt to meet
the new vibrations, thinking them
a language they could learn to answer
and added my cries
to echoes from the Inland Sea
when, twice, it boiled and white heat leapt
in waves back to the sky
and in shadow memory was urged
towards the bay off Iki island
where one porpoise under torture
drew two thousand to let blood
and saw far flickered messages
from sisters swimming under other suns
until in their ingenious deaf haste
men clogged that channel too
and when the sense of man sighed through me
I sent out only sorrow: he must move
in inner darkness, strung with pain.
How scarred he is, how young.
To sing is to join
the song of the universe
is fullness and emptiness
beginning and end 
But knowing there were so few left
to sing, to remember
I heard the colours of my notes grow tender
for the long pre-human clearness.
My journey was ending.
I could taste
the poison in the water and I knew
the baby stored far down above my tail
would not be born, my blood would use him.
When we meet in the depths
I sang, there will be leaping
bodies matching as minds do
as stars and darkness in that deeper ocean
though I felt only exhaustion
fear in an oily tide
and anger like white flashes
spreading outwards from the land
Of our coming is no trace
in our leaving is no goal
formlessness is the sum
of the singing of all things
All over the world, every year
whales have woven new strands in their song.
I woke sensing the last one
was what I had lost.
LATENCY
On the grey stairwell winding toward sleep
at a turn where the stone tower widens
a hooded figure waiting
standing stiffly as if boxed by shadow:
a woman, gravely waiting.
It is the weight of her patience
seeps into me like dewfall
her utter abdication of appeal
or intent that makes me pause, turn back;
in pale rays from above, note
her sculptured stillness, folded hands
eyes like pearls sealed under stone.
Not so young as I had thought
but innocent, clear as an effigy
calm and passionate like a bud.
She waits patient as a creature
never introduced to hope.
Would not be sombre but that all her brightness
all her lightstepping's in abeyance.
Outside lie heaving acres of salt waste.
I lean close, as if to trigger
that drained face or dredge whatever words
she might be holding still for me to hear:
I am waiting in the dark.
My eyes are closed, my throat is clogged
growing over.
But I will go on waiting
till I am smothered back into the stone
and the moss begins to move
across my mouth.
If you would seek me then
fingers blundering over the relief
spelling my trail, remember
you cannot say you did not guess
who once stood silent in your tower
quiescent like your mind's discarded doll
one whole long stormy winter into spring…
Bats, that wrap themselves against the light,
begin to flicker from the caves below
thin voices at the very brink of sense
alerting me that all is dark around, and falling
but in a surge of sea-reflected moon
I see and will not easily forget
the face the stone-mute figure wears
was once my own.
Poems for a Sister
HEATHER
thatches the moon
on heights where nothing else survives
springs underfoot
curlew and lamb cry
the small cold whimper
of sunless water
shadows crossing
or lying still far down
within the peat
drowse now in the warm
balm of its honey-scent
bumblebee and larksong
each gentle flower
a chalice, brimming with nectar
glowing the hills' drab shawl
in the calm at the end of summer.
Fodder
The first winter that my sister had no work
She kept a twist of meadow hay
To hand, she missed her beasts so much.
I recoiled when she thrust it at me from a pocket.
Here, smell this!
Doesn't it remind you
Of cow's breath on a frosty morning, milking?
The gesture was a flicker of her childhood.
(Small corpses, shells, a living slow-worm once.)
Another lorry rumbled past the rented basement room.
It looks like scratchings from an old birds' nest.
But peering close I saw no grey at all;
It was the steady gold of late sun shafting down
From chapel windows or a thundercloud
With strands of green that had come through
Their three-day cure to mineral calm.
Timothy and ryegrass, stems with windshine on,
Seedheads like kittens' tails, and clover
Crumbling into tea — a still and breathing sweetness
Made me remember her excited over textbooks
Teaching me the names of all the grasses
And coumarin, that rocks the fields to sleep
In June.
For me, pulled threads of summer
A bracelet of bright hair
From afternoons gone cold.
For her 
Fodder, as good as you might find
For milk, or meat, or keeping sense
Alive.
Within my hand, a small warmth grew.
IN HER OWN WORDS
Standing in a shady wood
beneath a trees great branches
I longed to merge into the world
in which the spider dances
but not for her
that green and ferny heat
glimpsed ecstasy of merging.
For ten years, little in the way of
dance or blossoming:
organic processes, the rotting underside
were all that seemed to happen
while she yearned for the insect dance
to be tiny, to be part
a mist of dereliction
deadfaced days
in furnished rooms dank as coffins
never feeling safe or rooted clinging to the ruins
where love loosened, watching
herring-gull and magpie
thrive, the small quiet things
trod under.
A tiny spider weaves
silk threads
they sparkle like water
till a sudden blast of January
sweeps away everything…
SAVING
Seeing her smooth a dead mallard reminds me:
she used to call our back-field burials "saving" 
a word we older kids had found
to save her meeting death so tender
but I recall her warm, still-dimpled hand
stroking eyelids shut against the soil
she scattered with no acted, never-easing grief.
That hand has learned some power now.
Keyed with purpose focussing her pity
it reads the feel and sheen of feathers
for she can catch flesh in its wandering;
beguile it to stay, daily clenching a truce
with the long-known snatcher, the old shape-shifter
and I have watched the charging of her gaze
heard the bleak phlegm in her voice dissolve
seen rough-and-ready hands become devout.
She opens this corpse like a flower;
inside it is clear and delicate as fruit.
Peels finer than a blood-orange.
Salt and secret crevices all known
skin eased from its stiff clot of meat
the bird's delivered to an echo of itself 
a mirror-image joined above the beak
so all the nightmares can be hooked
from the back of its brain and the white skull sealed.
Her day flows seamlessly as silk
like the Ystwyth sliding sinuous below
forever shedding this spring moment's skin
and when she looks up it is from amid
a throng of brightnesses that she has saved:
kingfisher, kestrel, barn owl, fox.
CHOICE
I would choose spring pasture
sun-dappled birches
the beckon of the sea
far between infolded hills
she lives with scars
spoilbeds in the river's throat
shafts still dark, where the dropped stone
whimpers away out of hearing
a valley caught
in the visible flow of its going
the house that was her lair coming awake
as a nest abandoned in the trees above
the scree, growth's foothold
at the edge
with a kite-view up the valley
summits shrugging off grim forest
a daylong soar and
freefall of the eyes.
She is making a garden
by the waterfall and the washing pool
to the chuckle of elements
tumbling back
and the flowers stored far down
inside their bulbs
have found this year a heart
to blossom for.
The gouged rock shimmers with crystals.
Dusk broods, begins to settle
but here, up high, a lake of last
light trembles round her.
Owl cries hunt echoes in the mineshafts.
She leaves her door wide open to the dark.
IN THE TREES
(For Heather and Chris at Gelli Las, 1987)
In the trees
That do not shut light from your house
So much as sift and ripple it
To brightness
Loosed, like pollen, gently on your hair
And make a safe green room
Having slowly grown
Together, I wish you small continual song
Wing-stirrings, secret honey, stars
Mornings clear
As peeled fruit and late evening skies
Streaked and ripening.
May you, sleeping,
Sigh in one another 's arms
Like summer leaves
While white roots mesh
Letting each be other
But braced against the wind of winter;
Their aching done
May the ghosts sleep sound
On Castell Grogwynion 
Your light shine out
High above the frost-gripped valley
Your log fire leap and crackle
And your dream hold steady
Long enough for both of you to know
It was a true one, shared.
Being Fruit
Letters to Mairwen
RIDING IT OUT
Wind and rain
made an ocean of the air
the day you chose to be born
Angharad.
Sea gulped
at the grey land.
No coming ashore
could be easy — and you
supposed to turn
to dive headfirst into the light
to be held up and recognised —you
just waited, jammed in tight, the wrong
way round.
But it was even more miraculous
the way they folded back
muscle and skin like fanned-out petals
to make an opening
to lift you, glistening, out
your eyes already open, steady,
as if you'd always known
it was the only way
to break your mooring-rope to darkness
the pulsing birthcord
wound tightly, twice
round the stem of your neck.
BECOMING ANGHARAD
At first, no more than dappling
in the moss, a doubling shadow
on the floor of the forest
where summer has poised
two hundred times over, and passed.
Sealed now as if horizons fuse
and the moon has no power.
Simmering under mulch
a tiny relentless tick
too small to be sound
begins to croon me. me. me.
Twinning and tearing, swelling and splitting, cluster
and connection, budding and breaking
lapping and overlapping, folding
refolding
swaddling a sphere
that puckers, drills itself inward
fitting a core
and ridges a stalk
to hold up its flower.
Cells make their choices.
Too fine to have colour, a tendril rears
and reaches
strokes strands of an anchorage
out of the air.
Fronds stir
over gills.
Saurian calm.
A fullness of warm salt.
Sense is wakening, unwhistled, without
the touch of light.
A shirring, like wind-breath on water.
The shining bulges
once; is sucked back smooth.
Bud-burst of fingers: ghost branches
stretching.
Muscles flex silver.
Quickening.
Then, there is harelegging through hayfields
skydiving over quartz-sharp ridges
leapfrogging cirrus futures
drumming and drummer, hoofbeat and rider.
The stream on the dark side sings
in the quiet hours.
Oxygen sighs
in the catacombs.
The queen cells of memory
wait, neatly folded.
There is itching under velvet.
An eye presses to a dark window.
Deep under, meadow and moss-garden.
Warmth fits
against warmth.
The pool brims
to a porch
glutted with sunrise.
A whole round unpunctured unpenetrated
seamless whole
no hunger, no in- or out-ness; all core
held in the one place
rippling with the current.
Warm, full, ripe, held.
No more moving.
But the world flares and pulses,
thick-throbbing, and, everything molten, must quiver.
The bright sky squeezes and the pushing starts.
AFTER CHATILA
The stripped birches link arms
down the road.
On good days
this drive's an accolade
of leaves; today, Death Row.
All the way home, wet sandbags
lying discarded over garden walls
or sprawling lumpily beside the road
nudge my T.V. News-trained memory:
I have to look a second time
to see they are not bodies.
And violins, Beethoven on cassette,
speak of courage in those other camps.
I try to think of the sister
praying on her hill up there
to heal what is wounded, restore
what is lacking.
Though the sea
glitters on three sides, its killing salt
does not reach her garden.
She hears the fox bark
in the small hours and for her the woods
are rapt with whispering.
Hers is the house
with golden windows, facing west
where the sun goes under.
At nightfall too her window
testifies.
But so small.
So far.
CASUALTY
(April 15th, 1986, U.S strike on Libya)
Sure it would bound back towards the green —a wide
verge thick with gorse mist-snagged — and my
mind full of airstrikes
I did not think I noticed as the car drew level
how tall a hare can run, how easily;
staunch-thighed, a thoroughbred at exercise.
I knew the tipped alertness of its ears
and how much more presence it projected
than a rabbit, triumph in its singleness.
The long spring of its back
glowed like the ploughland I saw it swerve towards
too late.
It leapt up at my wing.
Bone jarred on metal.
Fur like snowflakes in the rear-view mirror
and a suddenly-small body
belly up, offering its brightness
to the sun just breaking through.
Signalling to crows its readiness.
Gold at her throat, in the crooks
of her elbows.
But truly dead
with no time to learn flinching.
Snow belly, blossom belly,
whose fruit now will not set
this morning you must signify
all peaceful browsers going quietly on
along green verges, making a dash
too suddenly, too late, for home.
KNIFE
I have a kitchen knife so sharp
It is a scalpel in my hand.
I watch the shadow of the blade
Slide underneath the surface, slicing through
Creamy intricate unseen connections.
Drawing it across a lump of unscored pork
I seem to hear the stuck pig shriek
Its hair salt-white and bristling still
Against hand spread to hold it down.
Earlier I made delicate incisions
Into the eye of a grapefruit
And a long slit in a trapped hare's belly
To lift its still-warm workings out — A dark blood-spongy fungus.
Vegetables yield fewer mysteries:
Sprouts I rip are small cold stones
But I carry a cauliflower in from the plot
Snugged like a head against my breast
Dew starting from it, big tears of surprise.
Once I worked all day cutting
In a field of winter caulis, methodically
Moving up and down the rows until the cool clean
Smell of slashed leaves grew rank about us
And women stooping to each blank white face
Felt like a ritual or a battlefield.
Our arms were aching, but a complicity
Of hand and eye
And the rhythm of the knife
Swept us through, past sunset.
WRITING EXERCISE
Blind with listening, his lips
fall open as his eyelids close
to leave his face unguarded
washed at the edge of a tide
he lets himself float out on
holding what might be a message.
Explores its curves and delicate interiors.
Matches smoothness to his cheek.
In the silence when the thing has been passed on
his fingers have learned gentleness.
Light bubbles behind seals.
Time hums in the warmth of his cupped hands.
"A white shell sucked clean by the sea
but full of purpose, like an egg"
he writes,"made for distance and dark water
A small boat, broken open"
but seeing the buzzard's skull, is horrified
by how his hands deceived him.
Cold.
Ugly.
Yellow, like old teeth.
Sight stirs scum and tar clots in his mind,
Stiffens the caul of knowing.
SMALL RAIN
(May 1986: after Chernobyl)
For weeks the wind strained from the east
So ground and air were dry with a touch of steel
the sky's face pursed indomitable, blank.
Close in the pod of our own concerns
we have reached the nunnery scene
when the first rain sighs and draws our gaze.
I remember teaching them rain-as-a-symbol:
fertility, wholeness, healing, grace.
Larkin's arrow-shower.
Heart's ease of tears.
This falls so gently on dust-stiffened green
new leaves and blossom that we've waited for
we open windows to its breath — and hear
a million small mouths suck and whisper.
I used to dream of dancing in the rain
with nothing on, Rhiannon confides,
and no-one titters, we nod and understand
a dozen women, eleven with their lives
unfolding, held still and curious as cattle
by rain in Wales!
We gaze and go on gazing
as though not one of us had realised
the world could go on glistening
poisoned.
The lesson falters; goes on 
but I am seeing each of these grave girls
as a kind of ark, and Ararat
a point in time we have to hope to find
and listening to our futures being fed.
SECOND LANGUAGE
(For Carys P., Carys T., Elena, Manon, Nia and Teyrnon)
I watch their faces rise to meet me
from the green depths of a culture
older than I can fathom.
They glide
as if weighted by dreams or water
through my lessons, taking notes,
assiduously handing in assignments
in good time, browsing gravely
through all the books I offer, thanking me—
and all the time I feel I could be
beguiling selkie people to the land
to the bright amnesiac desert air
where I burn off my life without blossoming.
Five girls and a boy riding a name out of myth
whose language fills the mouth like fruit
who have grown in the delicate light
of an old walled garden that was once the world.
Manon, whom I see in jet and amber
accepting tribute, was the first
tangled in the word-lures, drawn out
to stand beside me with her colours brittling.
She claims she heard no echoes, never sang
in her own language.
Now the others hover
offering in devout, tentative palms
iridescence from the inside of their minds.
In their calm faces I can find no clues
that they are still at ease in their own skins
that dredging for this voice has drowned no other
and my teaching has not made them strangers.
BLINDLY THE GLOXINIA HEADS
Blindly the gloxinia heads
butt towards light-swollen air
their naked stems
and blunt pink-membraned nuzzling
like a nest of mammal foetuses —puppy,
rabbit, human clones — that
in slow motion
squirm and thrust.
Soon each flower throat will open
in a silent perfumed sigh
so streaked with invitation
and so flesh-padded
such silks and frills, such showgirl purples
you'd think they could know appetite
might pulse and quiver on a fingertip
and yet bred sterile
the better to exploit their trick
of nursing disappointment underground
storing fruitless energy
for ever-brightening displays
of beckoning need
so season after season
we can enjoy their large doomed blooms.
Sudden total collapse without apparent cause
is quite common in these specimens.
Haf Bach
(A "little summer" in October)
The harvest was snatched weeks ago:
too late for anything
but pleasure now, lying all night
washed in wonder at the still-mildness
of the moonlit air.
We have thrown windows wide
to let it in.
The huge moons brims, begins to soften
round its edges.
It feels like sleeping on a vast resounding shore
within touch of the sea
though the air smells faintly of woodsmoke and apples
and it is quiet, except for young owls
learning to read
movement and shadow.
Question.
And answer: warm flutter of breath.
This stormy summer threw down
and scattered grain, held berries back
from ripening.
But, you tell me, everything does well
with so much spilling
and the known body of the fields we look out over
stroked smooth, lies tender and mysterious
with giving and more readiness to give.
In the morning, our windows
are momentary golden screens
streaming with moisture 
that has gathered gentler than rain
like a slow-oozing, crystallising
joy.
Next month, we know,
there'll be a hunter's moon.
Being Fruit
We start off more like fruit than anything:
Look at Leonardo's drawings
The womb split open like a green horse=chestnut
Ridged and rinded, pomegranate-tough
Not seeming tearable as tissue paper
The vet's warning on the ODAS lambing course.)
Injecting oranges feels just like flesh.
I know how fruit is harvested:
Each year I make a tiny ceremony
Cupping my hand to each apple and testing
Hardly more than easing its weight
Whether it has sucked enough
Is full of sweetness enough
To let go.
Then I settle each one
In a nest of waxed paper
And close the curtains against winter.
We end up parked in a bed
With a bag of guts and a stubborn bundle
White light staring us out
And wrists ready labelled.
The last words my mother found to say
Shoving us off in a lucid surge
This is the final indignity
Because we had to find a nurse to ask
If she could have her teeth in
So she turned her face
Away from us all
And, crossly, died.
There is something in that:
Some cussed strength we might all wish for
To pinch out the quick
Of our own aching.
That's how I thought she'd one it for my dad
And yet his blood goes whispering in my cells
Remember that we mark the ground
With all we've been, both what we meant
To spill or store…
Let someone feel
They made it easy, that it was
Somehow a harvesting.
Other Voices
POWER
My wing-tips finger the early stars.
They shiver at my voice.
I swivel my head to churn the still-green shadows;
Listen as they sink back into pattern:
Hear the twitch of a mouse
The tap of a beetle, the whisper of fur
On a body slung between mothwings.
The zigzag staccato of the pipistrelle.
Feel the whirlpool in each eye
Begin to suck and deepen,
Tugging darkness from its bones.
My mind flexes and the world
Breathes like panic, hiding.
Each nerve foams with prompting.
My feathers quicken and lift.
The deep roots of my primaries
Thrum and quiver
Let go
And the ground falls from me.
At first I move soft as mist
Drift light as a dandelion clock
Down the valley
But the cave in my brain
Rings with small cries, the clench 
And shudder of flesh, its warm
Red weight.
I come over the fields like the wind
Scooping darkness, threshing the sky.
My blood is blue-black
my head studded with eyes.
Inside the cradle of my legs
I carry hunger.
Since first frost I slept
in the curl of a yellow bramble leaf;
in a blazing instant
woke in the sun to spin my claim
paying out silk like blood or song
moving in a dance
the ancestors inside my head
crooned for me
working purpose to a mesh of clots
watching them become invisible
as the sun swam higher
feeling the spokes begin to thresh and turn
waiting shrinking my will to a small red glow
keeping my mind still as a pool
under dark trees 
waiting.
The hub of my life is hunger.
When the tremor in the air means meat
the hairs on my legs will stiffen and quiver
a whole body tingling
will lift me and launch me;
I will tilt the slack sack of my body
and finger my way down.
The wide gape of my legs
longs to enfold and mould what is mine
soothe its spasms in a shroud of silk
stroke it into succulence
love it until it is all juice.
I grow huge and glaring; begin to advance.

Pasture
 "It is better to be a child in a green pasture," 
Thomas More.
Better still to be
green stems that need no marshalling
to lie all one way;
grazed hard, growing stronger
topped, springing up as aftermath
Too many-headed to be hurt
gathering to a colour
never having to justify itself
needing no voice
except borrowed ones
and the clean smell of growing
not beckoning or posturing
not requiring to be told
it is good or brave or lovely
to go on opening quiet flowers to the wind
at the one set hour
soon after sunrise
Soil's silver fur in frost
its thatch in summer
craving no untethering
swaying to no hay-dream
of torment or ecstasy
a perpetual brimming present
with the whole earth 
an udder for nuzzling
a mest being filled
by the quick root's stroking
taking light to the heart.
Sweet in the mouth, inexhaustible
seeking no liturgy:
drying to cowbreath
a gloss on the hide.
OUT OF THE DARK
I am the last night of August, late.
Under the sycamores darkness is so full
it cannot sleep.
Four fields away the sea
dreams of suffocation.
The barley's schoolgirl heads
are bowed and waiting.
I am globular and slow.
My pores ooze salt and honeydew.
There is red wine still
at the corners of my mouth.
I feel the white rose arching to the moment
her petals peel and fall.
Ripe flesh hangs heavy
drags back to the earth.
Towards dawn I turn into a fat pale moth
blundering through cowbreath air
pressing my body against windows
seeking cracks in bedroom doors
to let slip the petals of my wings
where winter will not scatter them
before they are read.
In sea and trees and barley
and in your twisted sheets
I sweat and sigh:
I am the pause
between filling and flowing 
the hush
at the heart of bursting
I am all roundness
beginning to wrinkle
to blur at the edges with fever
to pucker and seep
and I ache to be sharpened
sliced back to the core
rubbed clean like a new moon
to be angular, lithe
to be thin as a flash
windblown and buried
to be quickened
to come out of the dark
with a new face
breathing clear horizons, wider skies.
To be September.
DROWNING
I could not believe
he would have
drowned them:
for four days
searched barn and hedge and cornfield.
Damn cat's getting sneaky —got
kittens somewhere, hidden.
Well, I'm finding homes for them this time.
But she and I concealed them still
covering our tracks, screening dishes
with pulled hay, keeping them
until they were too big to drown
until they would
look up at him
in blurred appeal and he would have to let
this last pair live.
Where I was going that morning I forget
(somewhere I think he didn't want me to)
and she had brought them out
being old enough to take their chance.
Or perhaps he had already found them.
It was windy, raining.
I was not dressed for climbing haystacks.
Carried them high, purring, purring,
wet-warm against my throat
burrowed a hasty nest
and pushed them in between the bales
below eye-level.
I have drowned kittens;
have made my hands into hooks
to root them out and plunge them coldly in
learning they die less hard
stuffed into sock, like suddenly-remembered
dressing Tiger for the dolls' pram.
I would rather have done it.
I would rather have known.
But he let me search and ch-ch-ch
four days, playing me back
simulated innocence
until the cat came home lump-bellied
and a neighbour's yellow labrador
as we talked gardens, unearthed and brought
a dirty glove-limp thing
and dropped it on my feet.
He had not even dug
a hole, just pushed the bodies in
like onion sets.
In nightmares still I see my seedbed
heave, a small white swimming paw
break surface, and I slam
the spade down hard.
We have never talked of this.
I hope he does not realise
how much small things hurt
how long they take to die 
but I don't know if I still believe
that something being drowned
comes up three times.
SAMIZDAT
One night I stayed with Volodya
copying forbidden words
long after midnight.
When I finished typing all the names
for the new petition, Stay with me
he said, but I was weary and my mother waiting.
Walk me back?
That week
I'd earned two shadows, bullnecks
in greasy raincoats, so Walk with me
only to the new lights by the river.
So its time to play the timid virgin?
You're so proud of your bodyguard let them escort you!
Out of the rooted strength of being ready
to smile in the dark of the police car
to move joyously to stand up bruised beside him
to make the responses he might ask of me
I said nothing, only kissed him.
Gorokhovaya Street was black and empty.
I breasted the dark like a swimmer
trying to think only of the shore of my bed
but there was a quiet surge
of steps behind me, and again
behind me as I turned.
One held me as the other tore
my dress and then the pale flesh under.
Their breath was carnivores'.
When they tossed the used rag of my body 
from the railings, I fought like a cat
but only ice-water listened.
Volodya told a friend to tell me
he could not risk
the hospital.
I should have liked, just once
to look him in the face again
my teacher.
For he showed me
the eye of the shadow
I must look into
the small cries of ice forming
to which I must listen
words from the ashes
to scratch in the small hours:
the way to a list with my own name on.
OUTSIDE THE WIRE
She kept it to herself for years
after she got out, how
stumbling from the car, she fell into
all the growing smells of forest
and felt herself and all her senses
drinking.
He
was handing her his wristwatch.
An hour.
He would be back
exactly in an one hour.
She understood.
Quiet seeped back slowly.
On all sides
the friendly sibilance
of running water.
The sun began to lean
across her shoulders, to linger colours
in young birch leaves and to stroke
birds' throats back into singing.
The watch metal grew warm against her palm
and suddenly she was listening for dogs
feeling sights trained from the deeper trees.
Some sort of test — a ritual May hunt—She
thrust the watch well down
between her breasts, dragged off
coat and blouse and carefully
lay down, her face turned up, stylised
to catch the light of obvious innocence.
Her bare skin grew prickles, waiting
till insects stirred beneath her
in the leafmould, the centuries of cone 
and pine-needle; till she could almost feel
thin grasses sprout whose seeds
had baked then frozen under snow,
harebells hurrying to unfurl.
Siberia forgiving winter, that must come.
On a crest in the endless dark
green corrugations, from three larches
that she looked for against sunset
grateful she could guess
which way was home, the huts were ordinary
merely functional, a farm
stockyard trampled to the sterile grey
of dry cement or the crumbling bread
she would not fight for any more.
She'd left the whey-faced women in her hut
exulting plans for this one holiday.
A chance to heal, swap stories,
pick out each other 's lice — while under orders, she
got to the gate unnoticed
watched it swing open slowly, like a dream
in which her gagging fear
was wakening.
Three minutes.
She let fall
the flowers she had gathered like the child
who had once cried to see them wilt
so soon.
The staleness of the camp
closed round her with the clothes
picked up by the road, shrugged on.
The smallest blossoming twig
she tucked inside her sleeve to carry back.
As the second hand slid into place
the car was there, the insect-faced lieutenant
still on his own.
Still stiff-backed, silent.
She could not even ask him, why?
A few weeks later, the trusties
shared the news: he'd shot himself.
But long after the flower
crumbled in her hand, she held it
and the pulse of that one hour
though she lost count of the years.
ON CALL
Are you in pain?
The reply is a blur of distress
the only words I catch (not wanting to)
but — doctor — I don't know what
to do with myself…repeated on a rising note
(and I am in black for ewe-grief
and buds forced open!)
Where does he find the strength
to see his face is kept tidy
his eye clear and encouraging
for the next, and the next?
Hang on
and we'll see you
after surgery — yes,
we'll be there
not so much promise or instruction
as a commitment like the seasons', sureness
collective authority alone
can lend
and as he puts the phone down
is preoccupied a moment noting it
I see where I am standing
is not forest, only at its edge
where the dusk between the tense dark trunks 
is charged with sobbing most of us
keep selves turned too high to hear
and, his face calm as paper
pearl-pale and luminous with sweat,
the doctor stoops to each low plea or moan
long fingers braced to read the pain
miraculously proofed against the blood
that smears primroses and trampled shoots.
Deeper in, the oaks are bent, not broken
though chemicals or salt have scarred the leaves.
The sourness of old rubbish fires
hangs in the air.
Behind me still
groans or shrieks as more trees lean
while others lie down silently
or with a long soft sigh.
But none of this
is what he's called to.
Scrubby hawthorns hold back at the brink.
A scree-slide; a final, excavated drop
and, where you might expect to see
the sky's last brightness given back by water,
a pit hidden at the heart of trees.
I glimpse the whimpering mud,
the heaving under gravel before self-preservation hauls me back
but he, because he sees, is going on
is resolutely scrambling over, down.
None of the crying is mine.
There is no hole I can stop
to make it less, to help.
Darkness is settling now, sliding
down to mouth the muffled voices
and he is in the pit there with it
but some shifting of the branches over me
some flaring of the distant sinking sun
suddenly lets me see he has
a lifeline running past me, back, beyond
a clearness of belief
that will reach as deep
as he is forced to go.
Yes — lifted, the tidy face
invites, the eyes encourage
my confession.
How have you been?
MAN OF GOD
He dreams of cat faeces crawling
and the corpse of a peregrine
that turns into his wife's face
bulging with maggots.
Buried in a small dark room
a two-year-old is still screaming
he will smash the world to pieces
if no-one answers and no arms fold round.
Time's spots on his hands
begin to eat in, yet there is still the sea's
huge shrug, the blind white stare
or fools' silver of stars.
But power hisses through his veins
like an injection of the antidote
at last discovered, the elixir
that will make him perfectly himself, and loved.
He knows, he has rehearsed the words.
Clenches his fist towards heaven
and cries for it all
to come tumbling around him.
COMETARY PHASES
Debris dragged through spirals of bright froth
Ashes of stars dead aeons ago
Kept moving on.
In the dark outside the frozen planet
Travels clenched and incognito
Till the warmth of a yellow star
Thaws and sets light to its gases
And the teeth of the solar wind
Comb acetylene tresses
So the wild-ice eye a mountain wide
Wears a shroud of fire
As it crosses each small tent of sky.
You could hardly wait for dark
that first night of seven we went out from the warm
into the smell of old bonfires
both muttering Patrick Moore's directions
like a spell for spotting comets.
All I could see
between the steel-sharp winter stars
a fuzz of light that might have been
a dead spring's fingerprint or a watering eye
but you wanted so much to have seen it
you were convinced enough to take command
and point the glasses — That's it — above the tractor —
there.
Raucous with disappointment, going in
you counted down the decades to declare
you will be eighty-seven
next time round.
I felt breath 
cling in my throat, the darkness tighten
as it might around a prayer
and it is like a prayer
for all men and the future of men
to hope your generation's not been grown
to melt in a flash or a madness of flesh
that tomorrow is a threshold
you can wave to us from.
In the clenched-to-cracking night
We mouthed the hope, gave it a name:
twenty-sixty-two
still trembles in the flinching air
and catches, bright rag on a bramble.
At supper earlier the three of us had talked
of Californian scientists who see
the foetal heart accelerate
translucent fingers tense and eye-muscles
steer frantically through their dark
when sounds of a high-revving motor
are played to swelling, quizzically-smiling moms
and wondered if there's anywhere on earth—Australasia
or Amazonian forest—to find an unborn innocent of engines.
Then it was time to watch "Tomorrow's World" 
and I thought of Sheila with her firstborn
encircling him with Mozart in the womb
but waking him at three months' old
to be a witness
to be held up towards the moon on television 
so one day he could say he'd shared
in man's first giant steps; and, deeper, glimpsed
a woman silhouetted against dawn
a huge low-hanging African sun and dust-clouds rising
her arms reached up and offering
the son who had survived
long enough to earn a name, his dedication.
It might have been that night I dreamed
a world where my companions and I
drifted like medusae on the updrafts
pulsing with the colours of shared thought
through cumulus that had the lapis glow
of neutrons or of oboe notes
and we sang to the sister races
to the whales on the blue-white world
and other singers under older suns
and woke with ankles crossed and arms
wrapped round, a deaf forked
creature or a chrysalis
that's glimpsed the shimmer of the wings
we've sacrificed
in the million years it has been taking
to grow the hand, to learn
its itch.
A second time we were too soon
for from a deep calm, blue like flowers
or a summer tide, only the boldest
stars swam up as if to graze
on some celestial lichen's gauze
so while I cooked you studied starcharts
the names like botany or music
wondering who, on what brilliant southern night
first joined the dots to recognise shapes
and faces in the constellations
the sky as storehouse for the tribe's
memories of men and gods.
The books are confident that we know better
the rhythm of stars' blossoming.
Waiting till the chicken cooled
you visualised some boy your age
face haggard as a grandfather's
lying under those same stars
wrapped in a cold dry hunger
fingering a handful of seed corn.
Even when your growing brain
shared my blood, your dreams
were yours alone.
I used to feel
you twitch as if in nightmare, even then.
Weeks later, where the year ends
on the longest night, a brimming moon and sky
alight with working.
Swirls of cloud
like vapour trails had scarfed the distant stars
but lower in the east
Jupiter with three attendant dancing moons
glittered like jewels…
Our windows spilled
thick slabs of orange light and curtain-muffled
the screen was beckoning and twitching
occasionally screamed
dizzy with feats and fleeting time-frames
but we dragged dad away and with the dog
purposefully trotting between smells
jogged the high-hedged winding half-mile
to the headland, to the edge of land
where its spread fingers sink
and go on holding
to stand on the top in the clean wind
watch the island lighthouse flower
seeding the currents, and feel moonlight
seeping in behind the eyes
widening the bay of inner space
wind nuzzling at our bodies' warmth.
He and I linked arms and kept our shadows close
and the cold way down
with you behind us somewhere, singing.
Indoors, our eyes were shiny, like dark moons.
January: mist drifts over
the fields, deepening like water.
Twelve years ago tonight
caught up in a swirl
stronger than the moving tides
of sea or air, mere hundred-fathom-stirrers
we brought each other 
to an unknown shore.
I was the boat, the frail-hulled rocking craft
my blood the tide
but you were the pilot
you gauged the moment, steered
both of us home
on the rim of the last stretched wave
where the journey begins.
Sometimes still I see your arms jerk out
to clutch the emptiness
not knowing yet they're not
firm-muscled wings or fins.
Then the first cry: the commitment.
It is frighteningly easy to picture our children
bald-gummed, big-headed as the babies
they sprang out of.
I see you
wrinkling back towards the knowledge
that looked out at me 
through your newborn eyes:
a wisdom I could not have given you
a darker inkling, quieter,
more accepting of empty spaces
than you could have sucked from me
(unless in my turn I'll remember).
It was only later
you focussed on yourself enough to cry
for the little comfort
flesh can offer.
At first 
a dry night rasping, a constrained stridor
scraped from you where you lay
carefully put
in your carefully-tended cot
(always grizzling against sleep
the wiping-out you craved and hated)
rising to a red-faced wet despair
clinging to the bars.
And when I hummed
old tunes that soothed my baby sister
something in them spiked your grief
to howling.
Now you like it
when the light has gone
and shapes become provisional—drawn
outward on a great dark ship
you tell me as I look in on my way to bed
and find you wide-eyed with the curtains back
gazing at the frosty stars, that emptiness
of old exploding suns that makes you feel 
There's something out there,
not just wastes.
And, Can we, you used to ask
go out exploring in the middle of the night?
But when two years ago I woke you
after midnight in mild summer
and walked with you
between the breathing humps of bracken
up Pen Cristin, we were both
hushed, half-afraid
as of disturbing something rarer-nesting and more hesitant
than ordinary dark.
(Watch an infant, any two-year-old
dribbling paint, dabbling a hand
in the bathwater, letting
a pattern grow: drawing the spirals
a shell obeys, or a moth to the flame
drawing the shape of the galaxies
a swirl that links
each drop of seawater, each stone
with every star.
There must be more than one focus.)
Once, we made a game
of listing brightnesses
until they seemed too many to be counted.
I remember telling you
your first word — golau, Welsh for
light; at once, savouring its consonants
like falling ash, like owl feathers 
you tried tywyllwch
as a fitting last.
Still winter, and worse cold forecast.
Ice grates at the pond's edges
the sun goes down red and resentful
yet already there are lamb calls in the dusk.
You too were beckoned in a dark time:
deliberately reached for.
I was a ruefulness, and later
my mother had no doubts what
I should be meant for: help, and company
and a comfort-keeper for her age.
I would not have you sing in any chains.
It is enough that nothing in your lifetime
can wash the air clean
that shadows burned into the stone
stretch out ahead of you
the dumpsites glow and tick
that strings of zeros
dark-ringed staring eyes
hold us numb and trembling
stoated by their vision of the future.
But even now, when you turn to listen
under the crying of the wind across the stones 
you can catch the chuckle
of continual creation, the budding of
new stones, new-shaped horizons
for other voices to sing over.
Though we pick up the corpse
of the snow-starved thrush from the gutter
the first blue morning in March
will throb with his notes
and we are all — Caligula
the singing whale, ingenious quick
bacterium or bristlecone
petals on the same bright flower
dying and sprouting
in the same warm working dark.
Despite the long arcs traced across our sky
like a loosing of grotesque new seed
that link us all in chains of fear
we can only celebrate
the thousand glittering particulars
on one small world
out at the edge of the spiral arms
of an insignificant galaxy
and find in this a kind of consolation.
A day of rain, clearing at evening.
A token search, after checking the ewes:
It's out there somewhere, pulling away
then both of us with schoolwork spread
on the table in the kitchen.
From between
Hamlet and The Seaman's Book of Knots
you find your Science book to tell me things
you think I should have learned (and perhaps did)
of quasars and the teardrop shape
the atmosphere assumes from space;
explain perspective and how while we turn once
light leaps across six million million miles.
There are no shadows on your face.
I lean on your learning, amazed, remembering
when your head lolled like ripe fruit
your hair darkening like corn
and warm as September, your simple need
was to sleep in my lap.
She is still clear, accessible,
that woman holding summer in her arms
or watching her own belly grow
all one winter on a tranquil island
but it is only ghostlight
reaching me, like signals
from a star that long ago blinked out.
There is no turning back:
when the blossom has fallen 
the fruit fallen or harvested
there is still the stars' brightness
through the empty branches
and when the tree itself is done
and leaves a clearness
the dreams, the molecules
will be moving together
to make something other
as you shrug your self between
almost daily-different selves.
Sometimes a shadow falls
or an itchiness of unhealed scabs
new accusations, griefs to come
fills the room and makes us
coldfaced strangers, wanting
to fight free.
Just now though
you are worrying that I'll burn
in hell for disbelief, and I'm imagining
even with the hundred thousand million
galaxies you've told me of
how light must be lonely
rare in that vastness where even the suns
are pinpoints of brightness
rushing apart
and how
some night in 2062
(if you have made it that far
and there are still calendars to follow)
you, an old man with a headful
of your own black howls and golden windows
having taken on the legacy
of all the accumulated tiny cries
that are the history of our species
having heard the whimper of truth
under your own accelerating wheels
old man, you will kindle my ghostlight
and though I am spun away
transparent as a leaf
the grey echo of the warmth we shared
will stir at your breath
flare like a campfire in frost
and touch you with its colours still.
Every cell in our bodies
knows how to die;
only minds have to learn
to let go
to dance in the spiral
or drift to the ground
and wait to be stirred.
Only the souls we are not sure
we believe in
may be stamped no return
Suns, even, burn out; are reborn.
Already it is April and the comet
too far to make the news.
From the Seychelles a postcard boasts
fading now but I have seen it
brighter than the moon.
Wonder's run its course.
The probes sent back
flickering blobs of red and green
that told the scientists
the core is blacker than coal.
So — only a nugget of flung fire
from the kitchen grate of the universe—no
flaming crucifix
brandished above Jerusalem
one whole slow-turning year;
no fiery interstellar sperm
with an annulus of diamonds…
Myth's half-life is as yet unmeasured.
Between us too a distance
growing as you grow, begin to move
out into a man's orbit.
Daily
in the summer I had to
offer both of you back
trusting more to a sense of luck or honour
than to skill
that the sea would not take you
have to hear you
in the cowshed splitting logs
muscles in my belly tensing
at the heave and thud 
as you throw the axe (too high)
over and over, then while I listen
a long resting pause.
Once core, I grow towards husk
a thin rim glinting silver
at the periphery of your world.
I hear the dry pods rattle.
The fire has died to a nest of grey feathers.
The last log sighs and stirs
in the white smoke
that eats it slowly.
While I sat scribbling I was hearing
all its resistance sweated out.
No more sparkfalls, no sudden late buds
of bursting light.
The last fire of this ending season:
tomorrow I will clear the ashes
of your thirteenth winter in our lives.
Time is like stepping backwards
you said tonight, the future's always dark.
It is late.
The whole house has gone heavy
with quiet so firm my mind can float on it
my hugged gaze sharpen
on all the greys of ash
and one burnt twig that keeps its shape
so like a twist of smoke turned solid
I reach a fingertip 
but before my nerves record contact
it falls apart, ready to drift
lighter than thistledown
each flake no more than a fingersmear
a moon-version of mothwing gold
a mineral incandescence
ready to dissolve
to be silver fire at the root
and sweetening to sap, creep
along branches and once more stretch out
to drink from the sun
accepting shapelessness
as next, and letting its warmth
linger all night in the stone
as consciousness must hover over
a brain settling towards sleep
relaxing thankfully into its own
unknowable underlife.
The last log suddenly breathes out
a silent exhalation of white smoke
like an Indian signal
a clue to a question
or some old clutching having been let go.
