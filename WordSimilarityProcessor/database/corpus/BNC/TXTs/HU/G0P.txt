‘It doesn't make sense,’ said Detective Constable David Mackenzie.
‘They disable the alarm, use a glass-cutter to get in, don't leave any prints behind and wear masks in case they're spotted.
They cover every eventuality but they don't take anything.’
He shook his head.
Standing in the sitting-room he looked around in bewilderment.
‘Nothing's even been broken, let alone taken.
Burglars usually ransack the place.
These two look as if they were being careful not to disturb  things too much.
as if they didn't even want anyone to know they'd been inside.’
Again he shook his head.
‘I've never seen anything like it before.’
He looked at Donna, who was sitting on the edge of the sofa stroking her neck slowly.
‘You're sure nothing was taken, Mrs Ward?
I know you say you've checked…’
‘Nothing was taken,’ she interrupted him.
The clock on the mantelpiece said 2.36 a.m.
The police had arrived more than thirty minutes ago.
Already they'd dusted for fingerprints but found none that shouldn't have been there.
Donna had called them from Jackie Quinn's house, telling Jackie there was nothing to worry about.
Did she really believe that herself?
She'd told Mackenzie that one of the men had been injured, badly, as far as she could tell.
Word had been put out to surrounding hospitals that all casualty admittances with leg injuries were to be reported.
The two women had not been able to help much by way of descriptions apart from recounting details of the horrific masks the burglars wore and that one appeared to be rather thin (the one with the broken leg).
Mackenzie had no doubt that the masks and the clothes they wore would have been discarded by now.
‘You say no shots were fired by you or the burglars, Mrs Ward?’ the policeman enquired again, checking his notepad.
‘No.
You only have to check the gun for that,’ Donna said wearily.
‘And you can verify that the guns are licenced?’
‘My husband and I both held Firearms Certificates.
We were members of a gun club; we shot there regularly.
I'll give you the number if you want to check it out.’
‘Just routine,’ he said, smiling.
‘Why did you have guns in the house, Mrs Ward?’
‘My husband was away from home a fair bit.
He said I should have more adequate protection than a burglar alarm.
It was my husband who insisted I learn to shoot.’
Mackenzie nodded.
‘Am I the one on trial, Detective Constable?’ she said irritably.
‘I have to ask these questions, Mrs Ward,’ he said apologetically.
‘I mean, this isn't New York.
It's not every day a young woman pulls a gun on a burglar.
This is new to me.’
‘I didn't pull a gun on him,’ Donna corrected.
‘I was protecting myself and my sister.
God knows what would have happened if he'd got upstairs.’
‘Would you have shot him?’
Mackenzie asked flatly.
‘My house has been broken into, my sister and I could have been in danger and all you're concerned about is whether or not I would have shot the bastard who did it.’
She glared at him for a moment.
‘To tell you the truth, I don't know, but I'd like to think that I  could have pulled the trigger if I'd had to.
But if I had, it'd be me you'd be arresting, wouldn't it?
To hell with saving my own life and my own property.’
She ran a hand through her hair.
Mackenzie lowered his gaze a moment, his voice softening.
‘Mrs Ward, do you think this break-in could have anything to do with your husband's death?’ he asked.
‘You're the policeman; you tell me.’
Mackenzie could only shrug.
‘It was just a thought,’ he added belatedly.
Donna was already certain there was a link.
Mackenzie looked around him.
‘I don't think there's anything more we can do here now.
We'll leave you in peace.’
Donna got to her feet, ready to show him out, but the DC motioned her to remain seated.
‘There is one thing, Mrs Ward.
The fact that they broke in but didn't take anything, and also that they were obviously professionals, makes me think they were looking for something specific.
Something particularly valuable, perhaps.
Can you think what it might be?’
Donna shook her head gently.
‘Do you think they'll come back?’
Julie wanted to know.
‘Normally I'd say no, especially after having had a gun pointed at them.
But if they were looking for something, and it's that important  to them, then it's possible.’
He looked at both women.
‘Be careful.’

The pain was excruciating.
Howard James had felt pain before, but nothing to compare to the agony he felt from his shattered leg.
‘Get me to a fucking hospital,’ he said, frantically shaking the arm of the man who sat next to him.
Robert Crossley looked down at his companion huddled in the passenger seat of the Orion, his broken leg stretched out before him.
The splintered bone was clearly visible poking through the rent in his trousers.
Blood had congealed thickly on the end of the smashed fibula.
There was dark matter oozing slowly from the centre of the bone which, Crossley concluded with revulsion, was marrow.
The stench inside the car was almost overpowering.
‘How much longer do we have to sit here, waiting?
I need help,’ wailed James, his cheeks tear-stained, his skin milk-white.
Crossley wiped perspiration from his face and looked at his watch.
3.27 a.m.
It was almost thirty minutes since he'd made the phone call, stopping off quickly at a payphone before swinging the car off the main road and into Paddington Recreation Ground.
The vehicle and its two occupants now stood silently in a children's playground.
The wind, blowing across the open ground, turned the roundabout and Crossley looked up nervously every time he heard it creak.
Swings also moved gently back and forth in the breeze, as if rocked by some unseen hand.
Beside him, James continued to moan loudly as the pain seemed to intensify.
‘I can't take this much longer,’ he hissed through gritted teeth.
‘Please.’
Crossley nodded and looked round again, as if seeking inspiration from the children's slides and climbing-frames.
He heard the soft purring of a car engine and saw the Montego rolling slowly towards them, its driver flashing his lights once as he approached.
‘Who is it?’ gasped James.
Crossley didn't answer.
He pushed open the driver's side door and clambered out, unsure whether to approach the Montego or wait.
He decided to wait, watching as the driver switched off the engine and slid from behind the wheel.
He walked with brisk steps.
A strong breeze ruffled Crossley's hair and made him shiver.
Inside the car James was huddled in the seat like a whimpering child.
‘What went wrong?’
Peter Farrell snapped, looking at Crossley then down at the injured James.
‘She had a fucking gun,’ Crossley told him.
‘I wasn't going to argue with a gun.’
‘So you found nothing?’
Farrell persisted.
Crossley shook his head.
‘Did you check his office.
Upstairs?’
‘We didn't get that far,’ Crossley said.
Then, turning towards his injured companion, ‘We've got to get him to a hospital, he's hurt bad.’
‘The police will have put out checks on every hospital for miles.
How bad is it?’
Farrell demanded.
‘Look for yourself,’ Crossley told him and pulled open the passenger door.
Farrell saw the smashed bone sticking through skin and material.
‘You were careless,’ he said irritably.
‘We were unlucky,’ Crossley protested.
‘Same thing.’
‘And what the fuck would you have done if she'd pulled a gun on you?’
‘Pulled one on her,’ Farrell rasped, taking a step closer so that his face was inches from Crossley's.
‘You could have jeopardized everything.
We won't be able to get near the house for a while; they'll be expecting it.
You fucking idiots.’
He turned his back on them for a moment, hands planted on his hips.
‘So what do we do about James?’
Crossley asked.
‘He needs help, for Christ's sake.’
Farrell turned slowly.
His hand went to the inside of his jacket.
Crossley's mouth dropped open as he saw the taller man pull a gun into view.
The silencer jammed into the muzzle of the .45 made the weapon look enormous.
Farrell fired two shots into James's head.
The first hit him on the bridge of the nose, almost severing the appendage and taking out an eye as it exited.
The second blasted away most of the back of his head, spraying it across the driver's seat and the side windows.
The body toppled sideways, the eyes still staring wide in shocked surprise, the mouth still open.
‘Get rid of the body and the car,’ Farrell said flatly.
‘Call me when you've done it.’
He turned and headed back to the Montego, pausing as he opened the door.
‘Crossley, you fuck up this time and I'll kill you, too.’
He climbed into the car, started the engine and drove off, his lights still out, disappearing into the darkness.
Crossley looked down at the corpse, the breeze bringing the stench of blood and excrement to his nostrils.
He shivered and he knew it wasn't just the wind.
The roundabout creaked again.
The swings moved gently back and forth.

The porter accepted his tip gratefully, nodded and glanced at Donna as he left, smiling approvingly when her back was turned.
She waited until the door was closed and then crossed to the window of her suite, pulling the curtains aside.
The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin overlooked St Stephen's Green and Donna gazed out onto the park for a moment, glad to be safely at the hotel.
‘The most distinguished address in Ireland,’ boasted the legend on the desk notepad.
Donna stood at the window a moment longer, gazing out at the people in the street below.
Finally she lifted her small suitcase onto the bed, flipped it open and began taking clothes out, sliding them into drawers.
The flight had been smooth but Donna didn't enjoy flying.
It didn't frighten her; she merely disliked the physical act of getting on a plane and sitting there for the duration of the journey.
Fortunately the Aer Lingus 737 had delivered her from Heathrow in less than an hour, so she'd barely had time to become bored.
She'd promised to phone Julie that night to let her know she'd arrived safely and to check on her sister.
The break-in of the previous night had shaken them both, but Julie more so.
Donna finished unpacking and crossed to the desk where her handbag was.
She sat down, reached inside and took out an envelope, removing the contents.
There were a dozen American Express receipts inside, each bearing the name of a hotel.
One of them bore the name of The Shelbourne.
She flipped open Chris's diary and ran her finger down the entries.
She checked the date on the Amex slip against the entry for Dublin in the diary.
It matched.
So did the one for Dromoland Castle, County Clare.
And The Holiday Inn, Edinburgh.
The Mayfair, London.
Every entry in the diary was matched to a receipt.
Only some of them had the initial D beside them; it was these which Donna was interested in.
It had been simple to find out which hotels Chris had stayed in.
He always paid by credit card and he always kept the receipts for his accountant.
She had merely unearthed them from his office.
How many of these places had he stayed with Suzanne Regan?
Donna swivelled in her seat and looked across towards the bed.
Had he stayed here?
She tried to drive the thought from her mind, feeling an all-too familiar surge of anger and sorrow.
If only she'd been able to ask him why, perhaps it would have been more bearable.
For a moment, Donna felt tears welling up in her eyes but she fought back the pain, forced the thoughts away.
There would be plenty of time for them in years to come, she thought wearily.
For now she replaced the receipts in the envelope and pushed it into a drawer beneath some clothes.
She put the photo of Chris and the five men in there too.
The diary she dropped back into her handbag.
Donna got to her feet and padded across to the bathroom where she showered quickly, rinsing away the dirt of the journey.
Travelling always made her feel grubby, no matter how luxurious it was.
She pulled on one of the towelling robes and wandered back into the bedroom, selecting clean clothes.
A white blouse, jeans and some flat suede boots.
She dried herself, dressed, brushed her hair and re-applied her make-up, then inspected her reflection in the mirror.
Satisfied, she slipped on her jacket and picked up her handbag, pausing to look at the diary once more and its mysterious entry:
JAMES WORSDALE: DUBLIN NATIONAL GALLERY.
As she made her way to the lift and jabbed the button marked ‘G’ she found her heart thumping a little faster than normal.
Outside the hotel she asked the doorman to get her a cab.
She was at the gallery in less than five minutes.
Thirty-Seven
It was as imposing an edifice as she'd ever seen.
A massive grey building, its frontage decorated with stone pillars, its grounds were dotted with statues.
The gallery itself looked as if it had been carved by some giant sculptor, minute details in the stonework wrought by caring as well as skilful hands.
Donna had only seconds to appreciate its beauty; she had other things on her mind.
She paid the taxi-driver and walked briskly towards the main entrance of the building, slowing her pace as she reached the flight of broad stone steps that led up to the doors.
This was going to cause more problems than she'd thought, but it was the first place to try.
For one thing, there was no time in the diary for meeting Worsdale.
Coupled with that, she had no idea what the man looked like.
As Donna climbed the stairs slowly she looked around at the dozens of people entering and leaving the building, wondering how the hell she was supposed to find someone she'd never seen before.
Perhaps her husband and Worsdale had agreed a certain meeting place inside or even outside the gallery.
She entered the building, wondering how she was to find this elusive man, wondering again what she was going to tell him even if she did succeed in locating him.
She gazed around at the paintings which hung on the walls, looking but not really seeing.
It was quiet inside the gallery, an atmosphere akin to a library.
That same hushed reverence pervaded the place.
Donna glanced at the other visitors, noticing how diverse an audience were drawn to such a building.
There were people of all ages, wandering back and forth, some studying the paintings for long moments others just glancing, some checking their guides, some making notes.
As she looked up she saw what looked like a loud speaker in one corner of the room.
A public address system.
The idea hit her like a thunderbolt and she spun round, heading back towards the main entrance, remembering that there was an enquiries desk there.
She could get them to broadcast an announcement for her, spread the word around the gallery that Mr James Worsdale was to come to the main entrance.
She smiled at her own ingenuity, the smile fading as she realized the ploy would only work if Worsdale was actually in the gallery.
But, she thought again, her mind accelerating now, there was another way.
She could leave a message at the desk.
Get them to put a sign up telling Mr  Worsdale to contact the Shelbourne Hotel and ask for Mr Ward.
Pleased at her plan, she smiled as she approached the desk.
She'd find him yet.
There was a man seated behind the desk reading a book.
He looked up as Donna approached and smiled at her.
She returned the gesture, struck by his good looks.
He was in his late twenties, thick-set, dressed in jeans, with his long hair pulled back in a pony-tail.
‘Can I help you?’ the attendant said happily.
‘Yes, I think you can,’ Donna told him.
‘I'm looking for someone.
I'm supposed to meet them here but I've forgotten where,’ she lied.
‘I was wondering if you could put out a message over the public address system to tell him I'm here.
If that's okay?’
‘It's not supposed to be used for that, really,’ he said apologetically.
‘It's newly installed.
We've had a couple of bomb threats lately and it's been installed to warn staff to clear the building.
I'm sorry.’
‘This is very important,’ Donna insisted.
‘Please.’
She could feel her heart sink.
If this failed she was lost.
‘I shouldn't,’ the attendant said, but then smiled broadly.
‘But what the hell.
What's the name of the person you're looking for?’
Donna smiled broadly.
‘Thank you, I appreciate it,’ she said, relieved.
‘His name is James Worsdale.’
The attendant's smile faded rapidly and he looked at Donna with narrowed eyes.
‘Are you sure?’ he asked.
‘Yes, I'm sure.
Is there a problem?’
Her own smile was replaced by a frown.
‘I can put out the announcement but I don't think James Worsdale will show up.’
‘Why not?
How do you know?’
‘Because he's been dead for over two hundred years.’
Thirty-Eight
The smile on the face of the attendant was a marked contrast to Donna's expression of shocked surprise.
As he saw her concern, again his smile faded.
‘Well, let's say the James Worsdale I know has been dead that long,’ he said apologetically.
‘But if there's another…’
He shrugged.
‘It's an unusual name.’
Donna's mind was still reeling but she reached for her handbag, pulling out the diary.
‘Look,’ she said, thrusting the book at him and pointing at the entry.
‘James Worsdale, Dublin National Gallery.’
‘You're in the right place, then.
His work is exhibited here.
He's not.’
Donna shook her head, now totally puzzled by what she'd heard.
She felt a little foolish, too.
‘I'm sorry,’ she said, and turned to leave.
‘Wait,’ the attendant said.
‘Have you got five minutes to spare?
You came here to see Worsdale's work; the least I can do is show it to you.’
She hesitated, then smiled thinly.
‘Five minutes?’ she repeated.
‘I feel such an idiot,’ she said.
‘No need to.
You wouldn't be the first one through these doors,’ he nodded towards the main entrance and smiled broadly.
The gesture was infectious and Donna at last found herself grinning, too.
The attendant clambered out from behind the counter, one of his colleagues taking his place.
He walked around to where Donna stood and motioned for her to follow him.
Again she was struck by his good looks and his relaxed, easy manner.
He introduced himself.
‘My name's Gordon Mahoney,’ he told her.
‘Donna Ward.
How long have you worked here?’
‘Six years.
It pays to know whose paintings are exhibited here.
People are always asking questions.’
‘But not always looking for the artist,’ she said.
Mahoney grinned.
‘What makes Worsdale's work so interesting to  you?’ he wanted to know as they walked through the gallery, passing among the tourists and the students and the other visitors.
‘It was my husband who was interested in him,’ she said a little sadly.
‘Is he with you today?’
‘He's dead.’
She swallowed hard.
‘I'm sorry,’ Mahoney said quickly.
‘Was he interested in obscure Irish painters, then?’
‘Was Worsdale like that?’
‘He wasn't one of our most famous painters.
Maybe obscure is being a little unkind to him, though.’
They climbed a flight of stone steps and reached another floor.
Mahoney moved briskly along, glancing at Donna every now and then.
He finally came to a halt and made a sweeping gesture with his arm designed to encompass the array of canvases on the wall.
‘This is some of James Worsdale's work,’ Mahoney explained.
Donna stood looking at them, listening as the attendant pointed out each canvas in turn and told her a little about it.
They were unremarkable works: landscapes, portraits and still-lifes.
She could see nothing amongst them to explain why Chris should have been so interested in the artist's work.
She knew very little about art and couldn't tell if the paintings were brilliant or not.
To her, they looked accomplished but ordinary.
What the hell made Worsdale so interesting to her late husband?
‘What was your husband looking for?’
Mahoney wanted to know.
Donna merely shook her head gently, looking from canvas to canvas.
‘I honestly don't know,’ she said quietly.
‘Is this it?
All of his paintings?’
‘All we have.
Well, nearly all.
There's one in storage.’
He smiled.
‘In fact, it's permanently in storage and it's probably the most interesting thing he ever painted, but the subject matter makes it a little, how shall I put it, undesirable for public display.’
‘Why, is it obscene or something?’ she asked.
Mahoney laughed.
‘Anything but.’
‘So why is it never put on show?’
‘You could say it's something of an embarrassment.’
He looked at her and held her gaze.
‘Could I see it, please?’ she asked.
Mahoney hesitated, his infectious smile fading.
‘I don't know.
Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it.’
He looked around, as if afraid that someone might be listening to their conversation.
‘It could be important,’ she persisted.
He nodded finally.
‘Okay.
Come with me.’
Thirty-Nine
Nothing about the gallery had been how Donna had imagined it.
It was not filled with crusty old men and women poring over the paintings; the whole building had a bright and open atmosphere, instead of the sullen brooding one she'd expected.
Most of all, Mahoney didn't look like the sort of man who would work in an art gallery.
He seemed too young and vibrant for work she had previously thought to be the province of uniformed men with starched collars and even stiffer demeanours.
Every cliche she had held had been exploded by her visit.
The room where paintings were kept in storage was no exception.
She had been expecting a small, dusty room filled with paintings draped in cloths that were thick with dust, where air would have a musty scent of old canvas and decay.
Instead the room was light and airy, lit by fluorescent lights and smelling pleasantly of air freshener.
There was a thermometer on the wall displaying the temperature, ensuring that it was constant so that the paintings were preserved correctly.
There was an expel-air machine on a bank of filing cabinets which rattled in the stillness of the room.
The paintings were carefully stored in crates dependent on their size.
Others were propped  against the walls.
These, she noticed, were covered by white dust sheets.
Some appeared to be covered by what looked like cling film.
‘How do you decide which paintings go on display and which are kept here?’ she asked, following Mahoney through the room.
‘We display them on a kind of rotation system,’ he told her.
‘Each artist is allocated a certain amount of space in the gallery.
The paintings are usually left on display for three months, then one or two are replaced.
Those not on show are kept in here.’
He reached a canvas covered by a dust cover and paused.
‘You wanted to see all of James Worsdale's work?’
She nodded.
‘Like I said, this one is hardly ever displayed.’
He pulled the sheet clear, exposing the canvas.
Donna took a step closer, her gaze travelling back and forth over the gilt-framed painting.
‘Hardly what you'd call shocking, is it?’
Mahoney said, smiling.
‘Who are they?’
Donna moved closer to the painting.
It showed five men in eighteenth-century garb, four seated, one standing, bewigged and splendid in their clothes and obviously, for their time, wealthy men.
‘Five of the founder members of the Dublin Hell Fire Club,’ Mahoney announced with a sweeping gesture.
He pointed each one of the figures out individually, moving from left to right across the canvas.
‘Henry Barry, fourth Lord  Santry.
Colonel Clements.
Colonel Ponsonby.
Colonel St George and Simon Lutterell.
Rakes and profligates, the lot of them.’
He chuckled.
‘And proud of it.’
‘The Hell Fire Club,’ said Donna quietly.
‘I've heard of them.’
‘Most people have, and know something about the legend attached to them.
They were rich young men, out for thrills, out to shock the establishment.
They used to pass the time being cruel to the poor, gambling, whoring and indulging in most other perversions you could care to name.’
He smiled.
‘A little like an eighteenth-century branch of the Young Conservatives.’
‘Why isn't the painting displayed?’
Donna wanted to know.
‘The Hell Fire Club were something of a social embarrassment at the time.
Lots of them were the sons of well-off men, politicians and the like.
Not the sort of offspring you'd be proud of if you were in politics, or some other branch of the upper social orders.
Their motto was ‘Fay ce Que Voudras’, ‘Do as you will’.
And they did, most of the time.’
‘Was Worsdale a member?’
Donna asked, intrigued.
‘No one knows for sure.
That's the curious thing about this painting, though,’ Mahoney said, tapping the frame.
‘The two men responsible for actually starting the Dublin Hell Fire Club aren't in it.’
‘Who were they?’
‘Richard Parsons, the first Earl of Rosse, and Colonel Jack St Leger.
You know the horse race, the St Leger?
It was named after Colonel Jack's ancestor Sir Anthony.
Jack lived near Athy in County Kildare, a great drinker and gambler.’
‘What about the other one, Parsons?’
‘He was the most vicious of the bunch, from what I've read.
He had a fondness for setting fire to cats, apparently.’
Donna frowned.
‘A lovely crowd they were.
We've got a painting of Parsons here somewhere, a miniature done by another member of the club called Peter Lens.
I'll see if I can find it.’
Mahoney wandered off to another part of the room, leaving Donna to study the canvas more closely.
She reached out to touch the surface, aware of a chill that seemed to have settled around her.
As Mahoney returned she shook it free but her eyes remained on the painting.
What had Chris wanted here?
‘Richard Parsons,’ Mahoney announced, presenting the miniature.
Donna looked closely and frowned.
She could feel her heart thumping that little bit faster against her ribs.
‘I've seen this face,’ she whispered.
Mahoney didn't answer.
Donna traced the features with one index finger but it was not the face that caused her hand to shake.
‘Are you all right?’
Mahoney asked, seeing the colour drain from her cheeks.
She nodded.
‘I need to know about these men,’ she said, suddenly looking straight into his eyes.
‘About The Hell Fire Club.
How much do you know?’
‘I've read a fair bit about them.
What's so important?’
‘Will you meet me tonight, for dinner?
I'm staying at the Shelbourne.
Will you meet me there?
Eight o'clock?’
It was Mahoney's turn to look puzzled.
He nodded gently.
‘There's something I have to show you.
Something I have to know.
I think you might be able to tell me,’ Donna said.
Then she turned her attention back to the painting.
Again she found that she was quivering slightly as she studied the picture of Richard Parsons.
On the index finger of his left hand he wore a gold signet ring.
It was identical to the one worn by the man in the photo she had back at the hotel.

Julie Craig rolled over on the large double bed.
She sat up, her breathing heavy in the stillness.
She swung herself off the bed and padded, naked, across to the wardrobe, hesitating there for a second.
Apart from her own breathing, the ticking of the bedside clock was the only sound.
She opened the wardrobe and pulled the cord inside.
The small bulb inside exploded into life, displaying his clothes.
His jackets.
Shirts.
A couple of suits.
Julie ran her hand across them, feeling the different materials, her fingers lingering over the silk of the shirts, stroking gently.
She pulled one from its hanger and rubbed it against her cheek, her eyes closed.
Enjoying the softness she allowed the material to brush against her breasts.
The nipples stiffened and she squeezed her breasts through the silk, her breathing growing heavier as she kneaded the sensitive buds with her fingers, her excitement growing rapidly.
As she stepped away from the wardrobe she felt the moisture between her legs.
She drew one index finger through her dewy pubic hair, lifting the glistening digit, touching it very gently to her lips.
She shuddered, then slipped the shirt around her bare shoulders before heading towards the landing.
She paused at the head of the stairs, as if expecting someone to ascend; the house remained silent save for the creaking of settling timbers.
Julie turned and headed back across the landing, down the short corridor towards the office.
Outside she hesitated again, feeling the silk shirt around her shoulders.
She pulled it more  tightly, rubbing her shoulders, allowing one hand to slide across her breasts and down her belly.
Then she pushed open the door and stepped inside the office, flicking on the table lamp.
The dull light cast thick shadows in the small room where her brother-in-law had worked.
The atmosphere was slightly chilly but she scarcely seemed to notice it as she sat herself at Ward's desk.
She ran one finger across the keys of his typewriter and looked across the room to the photo of him which hung on the wall, smiling.
She smiled back at it, licking her lips, her breathing now deep, almost laboured.
Julie stood up and faced the photograph, slipping the shirt from her shoulders so that once more she was completely naked.
She moved closer to the picture, her eyes never leaving Ward's face, her feet brushing against the soft silk as she walked over it.
She knelt before the picture as if in prayer, then slowly opened her legs, stroking the insides of her thighs with both hands.
Julie had her eyes closed now and her head tilted back, so that her long hair dangled down and brushed against her arched back.
Her mouth dropped open slightly, her breathing deep as she allowed her hands to slide up her body, cupping both breasts, rubbing both nipples with her thumbs.
She opened her eyes, kept her gaze fixed on Ward's face and allowed her hands to glide over her smooth skin back down towards her pubic mound.
Her fingers stirred the tightly curled hair there, one index finger probing more deeply, grazing the hardened nub of her clitoris, stroking gently before plunging further to stir the warm wetness of her vagina.
She began to make slow circular movements on her clitoris, gradually increasing the speed, sliding another finger into her slippery cleft.
She felt a sensation of heat building up between her legs as she rubbed harder and faster and held her gaze on Ward's picture as the pleasure grew more intense.
‘Oh, Chris,’ she whispered as the beginnings of an orgasm made her shudder.
‘Chris.’
Forty-One
‘I owe you an apology,’ Donna said, pushing her plate away and dabbing at the corners of her mouth with a napkin.
Mahoney looked puzzled but continued sipping at his soup.
‘I never even asked if you had other plans for tonight,’ she said.
‘I can live with it,’ Mahoney told her, smiling.
‘I'm not in the habit of picking up men I've just met,’ she told him.
Especially when my own husband has only been dead for just over a week.
‘I'm not complaining.’
Donna smiled thinly and watched him as he finished his soup.
He was dressed in a black jacket and black shirt, immaculately pressed, as were his trousers.
His shoes were shined to perfection.
The long hair she'd admired was still drawn back in a pony-tail.
They'd drawn the odd inquisitive glance as they'd entered the dining-room of the Shelbourne, but Mahoney had been convinced that was because of the way Donna looked.
She would have turned heads anywhere in a navy blue backless dress which rose just above her knee.
Moving elegantly on a pair of high heels, she looked stunning.
Her long blonde hair, freshly washed, seemed to glow in the dull light from the chandeliers.
Donna looked at him again, wondering why she felt so guilty to be sitting at the table with this man.
Perhaps it was because there had been such a short gap between this meeting and the burial of her husband.
Do you think Chris ever felt guilty when he was with Suzanne Regan?
She tried to push the thought from her mind but found that it persisted.
‘I used to work here, you know,’ Mahoney said, pushing his bowl away and glancing around him.
‘I was a trainee chef for six months.’
He raised his eyebrows.
‘What happened?’
‘I managed to tip half a pint of crème brûlée over the manager one evening when he came in to see how I was getting on.
They sort of decided for me  that it wasn't my perfect vocation.
I was sacked.’
He raised his wine glass in salute.
‘Cheers.’
She echoed the toast and drank.
‘From there to the National Gallery,’ she said.
‘Via half a dozen other jobs.
I've been a barman three times.
There's always plenty of vacancies for bar work here.
We like our drink, the Irish.
More drinkers call for more barmen.
It's a simple equation.’
She found him looking at her a little too intently and lowered her gaze.
‘What made you come here?’
Mahoney wanted to know.
‘You said your husband was working on a book but that doesn't explain why you came to Dublin.’
‘I wanted to find out what he was working on,’ she said as the waiter removed the plates and tidied the table for the main course.
‘The entries in his diary were all I had to go on.
I think he was researching something, but I'm not sure what.
That's why I had to find out who James Worsdale was.’
‘And now you do?’
‘I'm none the wiser, unless his work was something to do with the Hell Fire Club.
It seems the most likely explanation now.
Tell me what you know about them, Mr Mahoney.’
‘Call me Gordon, please.
I've never felt very comfortable with formality.’
She nodded and smiled.
‘Gordon,’ she said.
He raised his hands.
‘There's so much to tell, Mrs Ward,’ he began.
‘Donna,’ she told him.
‘I thought we'd dispensed with formality.’
Mahoney grinned.
‘The subject is vast,’ he began.
‘It depends what you want to know.
It also depends on whether or not I can tell you what you want to know.
I don't profess to be an expert.’
‘You said you'd read a lot about them.’
‘I've seen a lot of horse races but that doesn't make me a jockey, does it?’
She smiled again and reached for her handbag, sliding the diary free, laying it beside her as if for reference.
The photo was in there, too, but she left it for the time being.
‘I know more about the Dublin Hell Fire Club, obviously,’ he continued.
‘They were just one of the off-shoots.
There were a number of branches affiliated to the main club in England.
They had individual leaders at each club but one overall head.
The affiliates were known as cells.
As far as I can tell there were cells in London, Edinburgh and Oxford as well as here in Dublin.’
Donna swallowed hard, one hand involuntarily touching the diary.
She remembered the entries.
Edinburgh.
London.
Oxford.
Her husband had been to all those places shortly before his death.
‘Where were the meetings?’ she wanted to know.
‘In Ireland, usually at a place called The Eagle Tavern on Cork Hill.
That's where Worsdale's painting was done.
They also met at Daly's Club, College Green.
That's where Parsons picked up his charming habit of setting fire to cats.
He'd pour scaltheen over them first.’
‘What's that?’
‘It was a mixture of rancid butter and raw Irish whiskey, I believe.
It's no wonder members of the Hell Fire Club were crazy if they drank that.’
The main course arrived and Mahoney sat back in his seat, seeing how intently Donna was looking at him, hanging on his every word.
She glanced irritably at the waiter, barely resisting the urge, it seemed, to hurry him up so that her companion could continue.
He finally left and Mahoney continued.
‘Their favourite meeting place, though, was Mountpelier Hunting lodge near Rathfarnham.
The ruins are still there today.
Kids drive up there at nights and try to spot ghosts.’
He smiled.
Donna didn't.
‘How was it destroyed?
You said there were only ruins there now.’
‘One of the Hell Fire Club members, Richard Whaley, accidentally set fire to it one night.
Well, he supposedly had drink spilled on him by a coachman so, by way of revenge, he poured brandy over the man and ignited him.
Whaley got out but quite a few of the others didn't.’
‘How difficult is it to reach?’
Donna enquired.
‘It's easy.
You can drive up there.
It's only twelve miles or so.
They reckon on a clear day you can see the ruins from O'Connell Street.’
He smiled again.
‘Have you ever been up there yourself?’ she wanted to know.
‘When I was a student.
Half a dozen of us went up there one night.’
He shrugged.
‘The only spirits I saw were Jamesons and Glenfiddich.’
He chewed a mouthful of food.
‘So what did they do at these meetings?’
Donna persisted.
‘Orgies, mainly.
They drank a lot, they gambled, supposedly they practised the Black Mass.
Their object was to undermine society, the Church in particular.
But most of all it was just an excuse for an orgy.’
‘What about the other clubs?’
‘They were the same, but all the other cells were presided over by the man who founded the order at a place in England called Medmenham Abbey.
They were called ‘The Monks of Medmenham’.
One man was responsible for starting the Hell Fire Club.
A man called Francis Dashwood.’
Dashwood.
D.
Beside every entry.
D.
‘Dashwood was the President of the club.
He used to travel around all the other cells to make sure they were carrying out their objectives.’
Mahoney chuckled.
‘They had a nickname for him.
They called him The King of Hell.’
Forty-Two
Gordon Mahoney held the brandy glass in his hand and swirled the amber fluid around gently before sipping at it.
The dining-room was almost empty; just one other couple occupied a table on the far side of the room now.
Mahoney felt exhausted, as if he hadn't stopped talking since he sat down earlier that evening.
Donna's questions had been unceasing, her curiosity boundless.
He regarded her over the rim of the brandy glass, captivated by her looks.
She certainly was a beautiful woman.
As she drank her coffee Mahoney looked at her, studying the smooth contours of her legs, noticing the way the dress clung to her slim hips and waist.
He felt an embarrassed stirring in his groin and shifted position in his seat.
‘Did Dashwood ever come to Dublin?’
Donna asked.
Mahoney sucked in a deep breath, preparing himself for the next round of questions.
‘I would think so.
Like I said to you earlier, he visited the cells all round the country.
Parsons spent some time in England, too.
They  were powerful men.
Dashwood was Postmaster-General of England at one time.
Most of the members were wealthy young men.
They were bored, I suppose.
Nowadays the rich snort coke; in those days they got drunk and had orgies.’
He smiled.
‘What about the witchcraft side of it?’
Donna wanted to know.
‘They were perverts.
It just gave them an excuse to do what they wanted in the name of the Devil.
A lot of what went on was based on gossip, most of it spread by members themselves.’
He drained what was left in his glass.
‘What happened to Dashwood and Parsons?’
Donna wanted to know.
‘No one knows for sure.
Parsons just disappeared, not long after the fire at Mountpelier lodge.
Dashwood died, supposedly, of syphilis.
The clubs broke up when too much political pressure was put on them, when it came out that some of their leading members were important social figures.
The scandal ruined them.’
Donna nodded slowly, drawing her finger around the lip of the cup.
Mahoney watched her intently.
‘Could there be a Hell Fire Club today?’ she asked finally.
‘Now, in the twentieth century?’
Mahoney shrugged.
‘Anything's possible, but if there was I think The News of the World would have found them by now.’
He chuckled.
‘I mean it,’ Donna snapped.
The Irishman was surprised at the vehemence in her voice.
‘A group of men meeting together to get drunk and cavort with women?
I should think that happens quite a lot, but I doubt they'd call themselves The Hell Fire Club.
You can see that on any guy's stag night.’
He shrugged.
‘Dashwood and Parsons had political objectives; they wanted to do genuine damage to society.
The clubs helped them recruit supporters.’
‘So you're saying that couldn't happen now?’ she said challengingly.
‘No, I'm not saying that.
All I'm saying is, I doubt if there are men practising the Black Arts and meeting on a regular basis for drunken orgies the way Parsons’ and Dashwood's men did.
I said it was unlikely; I didn't say it was impossible.
Supposedly there was a Hell Fire Club in London in 1934, but what they were getting up to no one knows.’
Donna reached for her handbag and took the photo out.
She pushed it across the table towards Mahoney.
‘That's my husband,’ she said, jabbing a finger at the image of Chris.
‘I don't know who the other five are.’
Mahoney inspected the faces carefully, pausing at the two blurred images.
‘Look,’ said Donna, pointing at the first of the fuzzy figures.
‘The ring on the left index finger.
It's the same as the one worn by Parsons in  that painting you showed me.
The other man is wearing one, too.’
Mahoney frowned.
‘They certainly look alike,’ he mused.
‘They're the same,’ she snapped angrily.
‘What are you trying to say, Donna?’ he asked.
‘Identical rings, one worn by a man in a painting done two hundred years ago, another worn by a man photographed less than six months ago.
It's a hell of a coincidence, isn't it?
I think that someone found the rings that belonged to Parsons and Dashwood.
Those men in that photo.
I think my husband knew that.
I think he knew who they were.
I'm sure that's what he was working on.
All the places you mentioned that they used to meet, my husband had been there recently.
I think he'd found a new Hell Fire Club.’
Mahoney didn't speak, mainly because he wasn't sure what to say.
He could see the sincerity in her expression and hear the belief in her voice.
‘I'm going to drive out to Mountpelier Lodge tomorrow,’ she told him.
‘Will you come with me?’
‘What are you hoping to find there?’
‘I don't know.
Some answers?’
Mahoney exhaled.
‘I told you, it's just a ruin,’ he said wearily.
‘Will you help me?
Yes or no?’
He nodded.
‘Pick me up at eleven,’ he said.
‘At the Gallery.’
‘Eleven.’
She nodded.
‘Gordon, there's something else.’
She licked her lips before she spoke.
‘Were women allowed to join The Hell Fire Club as members?’
Could Suzanne Regan have introduced Chris to the others?
‘No.
It was strictly a male preserve,’ he said, smiling.
‘A couple of the high-ranking members like Parsons or Dashwood had what they liked to call ‘Carriers’ but that was it.
The carriers were women chosen to be impregnated, made pregnant by members.
The children they bore would be used in ceremonies.’
‘Jesus,’ murmured Donna, taking a sip from her cup and discovering that the coffee was cold.
She winced and pushed it away from her.
She glanced up at the clock on the wall opposite.
It was 11.46 p.m.
‘Gordon, I don't know how to thank you for your help,’ she said.
‘I could think of a couple of ways,’ he said, smiling.
Donna looked at him coldly.
He raised his hands as if in surrender, then got to his feet.
‘Shall I get them to call you a cab?’— she asked.
‘I'll be okay.
The walk will clear my head.’
She walked to the main doors with him and said a quick ‘Goodnight’, reminding him that she'd pick him up at eleven the following morning.
Mahoney thanked her for the meal and left, stepping out onto the pavement.
The fresh air hit him and he sucked in lungfuls and drank them down.
After a few moments he began walking, pausing once to look up at the grand facade of the Shelbourne.
He wondered which room she was in.
Mahoney smiled to himself and set off.
He should be home in less than thirty minutes.
Not once did he notice that he was being followed.
Forty-Three
Donna left the hazard lights of the Volvo flashing as she hurried up the steps towards the main entrance of the Dublin National Gallery.
As she reached them she glanced back at the hire car, knowing that she couldn't leave it there for long.
She hoped Mahoney would be ready to go.
She'd called Julie that morning to make sure she was all right, and that there had been no more trouble.
Julie had told her she was fine.
Donna, satisfied that her sister was well, asked the hotel to get her a hire car for the next couple of days.
The Volvo had arrived less than twenty minutes later.
Now she reached the main doors and walked in, eyes flicking over the sea of faces in search of Mahoney.
He had told her a lot the previous night, too much for her to take in, but the salient points stuck out clearly in her mind.
She had sat up that night in her room, sitting on the bed scribbling notes on one of the Shelbourne's notepads.
She'd finally drifted off to sleep at about two, woken an hour later feeling cold and slipped under the covers, resting fitfully until room service brought her breakfast at eight.
She moved through the gallery quickly, looking for Mahoney but unable to find him.
Finally she returned to the information desk where she'd first encountered him the previous day, and found a pretty young woman sitting there stacking up guide books on Dublin.
‘I'm supposed to be meeting Gordon Mahoney here at eleven,’ Donna said.
‘He'll be back in a minute,’ the young woman told her, still stacking.
Donna glanced agitatedly at her watch and walked to the main doors, trying to see the Volvo parked in the street beyond.
When she turned again she saw Mahoney approaching the desk.
Donna smiled and approached him.
‘Are you ready?’ she asked.
He looked at her blankly.
‘Can I help you?’ he said flatly, his gaze barely meeting hers.
‘Gordon, it's eleven o'clock.
I've got the car outside.
Come on.’
The girl stacking the guide books looked at both of them but said nothing.
‘I can't go,’ he said sharply.
‘I'm working.’
‘What the hell is wrong with you?’
Donna demanded, irritated by his coldness.
‘I'm busy.’
He reached for a sheet of paper, picked up a pen and began writing.
‘Was it something I said, last night?’ she wanted to know.
‘Why are you acting like this?’
‘I don't know what you're talking about.’
She could hear a note of disinterest in his voice, but something else too.
Fear?
‘I've got work to do if you don't mind.
I'm sorry,’ he told her and continued writing.
The girl finished stacking the guide books and slipped out from behind the desk.
‘I'll be back in a minute,’ she said.
‘Gordon, tell me what's wrong?
Why are you doing this?’
Donna said through clenched teeth.
Mahoney looked directly at her, his eyes blazing.
‘Get out of here now,’ he snarled.
‘Leave me alone.’
Donna held his gaze, her own anger boiling.
‘Get the fuck away from me,’ he said vehemently.
Then he looked around quickly.
‘Get away from me, get away from this place, get away from Dublin.’
Donna frowned, opened her mouth to say something but was cut short.
‘Go.
Go now,’ he said, still not looking at her.
‘What do I have to say?’
She turned and walked briskly away from the desk, out of the main entrance and down the steps back to the car.
She slid behind the wheel and started the engine, pulling away so sharply she caused the car behind to sound his horn as he braked to avoid her.
Her mind still racing, she glanced down at the map on the passenger seat and then headed towards the road that would take her to Mountpelier Lodge.
Forty-Four
Perhaps it was her imagination, she thought.
Maybe she didn't really feel a chill in the air.
After all, the sun was out and high in the sky.
It was just her imagination working overtime.
Donna tried to convince herself of that as she walked slowly around the ruins of Mountpelier Lodge.
Perched high on a hill, the remains of the place overlooked Dublin like some skeletal sentinel.
The whistling of the wind was low, disappearing as quickly as it came, ruffling her hair.
She pulled the collar of her jacket up.
Evil places were said to retain an aura of Evil and, from what she had learned of this place from Mahoney, if ever that aura was present then it would dwell easily here.
The stone walls, what remained of them, were weather-beaten but untouched by overgrown weeds.
In fact there were no plants anywhere near the ruins.
Nothing grew in or around the stonework and, as she wandered around, she was aware also of the silence.
A stillness which seemed to bear down on her like a physical presence.
No birds nested here.
Nothing living, it seemed, would come anywhere close to this long abandoned dwelling.
Mahoney had told her that the lodge had been built on the site of a demolished cromlech, a tower erected for the worship of native Irish Gods.
Parsons and his followers had found it ironic that their place of depravity should be built on what had previously been Holy Ground.
As she walked, inspecting the ruins, she thought of Mahoney.
Of their evening together, of how forthcoming he'd been with his information.
How easy to talk to he'd been, generous in his desire to tell her what she wanted to know.
So why the change of attitude?
What had happened to make him treat her so badly?
It was another in a growing catalogue of mysteries and unanswered questions.
Donna feared they might remain unanswered forever.
At least some of them.
One thing she was sure of was the purpose of her husband's visit here.
Donna was convinced that he was investigating The Hell Fire Club or some organisation like it.
What she didn't know was why.
Christ, there were so many whys and wherefores.
Why had he been having an affair?
There was always that question.
She crouched and picked up part of the brickwork that had crumbled away from a supporting pillar.
Holding the stone in her hand, feeling its texture, she looked around the hilltop.
Still she felt that breeze ruffling her hair, biting at her nose.
Donna shivered and decided to head back to the car, not even sure why she had come here in the first place.
Perhaps Mahoney might have been able to point out something to her, tell her more about the site.
But Mahoney wasn't here, was he?
She tossed the stone aside and headed back to her car, looking round again, even more aware of the silence and lack of birdsong.
The only bird she saw was a crow flying high above, its black outline alien and unwelcome against the clear blue of the sky.
Donna slid behind the wheel of the Volvo and sat there for a moment, looking back at the ruins.
She wondered exactly what kind of depravities had occurred inside that place when it was standing.
She tried to imagine what an imposing building it must have been in its time.
Ironic that so noble an edifice should house so vile an organisation.
She started the engine and swung the car around, catching a last glimpse of the place in her rear-view mirror.
Inside the car it seemed to warm up.
In fact  the further from the ruins she got, the warmer she grew.
Imagination?
Donna adjusted the fan inside the car and headed back towards Dublin.
She glanced into the rear-view mirror, convinced that hers was the only car on this lonely road.
Exactly where the black Audi had come from she had no idea.
There were numerous dirt tracks leading off from this road, but she didn't recall seeing it parked in any of them as she passed.
All she knew was that the vehicle was behind her now.
And, as she peered more closely into the mirror, she could see that it was drawing closer.
Accelerating.
Donna frowned and put her foot down, coaxing more speed from the Volvo, her eyes flicking back and forth from windscreen to rear-view mirror.
The Audi was still gaining on her.
She tried to look over her shoulder, to see the face of the driver, to mouth some kind of warning to him but she could see nothing.
A combination of the sun on the windscreen and the tinted glass made it impossible.
The Audi was only yards from her now and Donna decided to pull in and let it pass.
It was then that it slammed into the back of 
Forty-Five
The impact flung Donna forwards in her seat, the safety belt preventing her from hitting the windscreen.
She looked round, seeing the Audi reverse slightly.
‘What the hell are you doing?’ she screamed to the unseen driver as the black vehicle came hurtling towards her once more, this time clipping her offside light.
She heard the crash of shattering glass as the cars clashed.
The Audi reversed a few yards.
This time Donna stepped on the accelerator and the Volvo shot forward, dirt and stones spraying up behind it as she guided it back onto the road.
She glanced in the rear-view mirror to see that the Audi was in pursuit.
She pressed down harder on the gas pedal, coaxing more speed from the car, trying to put more distance between herself and the maniac in the Audi, but whoever was driving the pursuing car had no intention of letting her get away.
The black car swerved out in an attempt to get alongside her.
The road was scarcely wide enough to accommodate two cars travelling abreast but the Audi ploughed up a grass verge.
Earth was sent flying  upwards in a dirty wall as the wheels spun on the damp ground; puddles of water at the roadside splattered up the sides of the vehicles.
The Audi slammed into the side of the Volvo and Donna had to use all her strength to keep control of the car.
Again she glanced at the windscreen of the other car but she could see nothing through the darkened glass.
She spun her own wheel, smashing into the Audi.
It skidded slightly and slowed down.
Donna accelerated, seeing a crossroads ahead.
She prayed there was nothing coming the other way.
The Volvo shot across the junction doing sixty.
The Audi followed.
Donna could feel perspiration soaking into her blouse and droplets beading on her forehead.
When she turned her head her hair was matted to the nape of her neck.
She gripped the wheel, looking alternately into the rear-view mirror and ahead, searching for a turn-off where she might be able to lose the chasing Audi.
The road forked about two hundred yards in front of her and Donna leant forward in her seat, willing the car to greater speed.
The Audi slammed into her again, the jolt almost causing the Volvo to skid, but she regained control and drove on.
Her mind was blank.
She was functioning on instinct alone.
Self-preservation kept her going.
There was the renewed sound of breaking glass as the cars clashed again.
The fork was coming up.
Which way to go?
Right or left?
She pulled hard on the wheel and took the left fork.
The Audi followed, spinning slightly on the wet road, the back end swinging round as the driver revved too hard.
The momentary lapse gave Donna time to edge away and she pressed so hard on the accelerator she feared she might shove her foot through the very floor of the car.
The road was beginning to rise slightly, an incline that led to a gentle crest.
Donna didn't slow up as she roared up the slope.
She was doing seventy when she reached the top.
The Volvo left the ground for precious seconds, flying through the air before finally crashing back down to earth with a sickening jolt that jarred every bone in her body.
She winced in pain as she felt a shock across her back at the impact.
The Audi came hurtling over the rise, too, one hubcap spinning away from it as it landed.
Donna grabbed the gear stick, simultaneously pressing hard on the brake.
The Volvo skidded for about fifty yards, its speed gradually slowing.
Donna jammed it into reverse.
‘Come on you bastard,’ she shouted and pressed down hard on the gas.
The Volvo hurtled backwards and Donna gripped the wheel tightly, knowing that this particular ploy was going to  stop the Audi or kill them both.
She didn't know which.
The impact was massive.
The speeding Audi and the Volvo slammed into each other with sufficient force to buckle the Audi's grille and shatter both headlights.
The Volvo fared little better but Donna closed her eyes tightly as the impact hurled her forward again and sent her crashing against the steering column with enough force to knock the breath from her.
But she forced the Volvo into first, the engine screaming as she drove fifteen or twenty yards down the road.
There was a loud crunching of gears as she forced it into reverse again, then sent the car hurtling again into the now stationary Audi, shunting it several yards further back.
More glass covered the road; she heard it crunching beneath the tyres.
There was steam coming from beneath the bonnet of the stricken Audi, water gushing out like blood from a wound.
When the black vehicle tried to move away she heard a horrible clanking sound and saw the bumper come free.
The driver reversed and the whole thing came away, dragged for a few feet by the car.
Donna sent the Volvo crashing into the Audi again, then shifted up through the gears and drove off.
The Audi tried to follow but it could not muster its previous speed.
Donna saw it in the rear-view mirror, convinced and elated that she'd done it crippling damage.
She shouted defiantly for  a second, tears forming in her eyes, tears of terror and relief.
Her body was drenched with sweat; it was glistening on her legs and she felt moisture beneath her on the seat.
Donna wasn't sure whether it was perspiration or if she'd wet herself in the hectic chase.
For now, all she could think about was getting away.
Getting back to the hotel.
Calling the police.
She looked again at the rear-view mirror and saw that the Audi was turning into a side road, allowing her to go.
Her breath coming in short gasps, she drove on.
Forty-Six
The bathwater lapped gently up around her neck as she slid deeper.
Donna pulled the flannel from the water, wrung it out and placed it over her face.
Her breathing was slow and steady, the only accompaniment being the slow dripping of one of the taps.
Steam from the water had clouded the mirrors in the bathroom; condensation had formed a dewy veil over the tiles.
It had run down in rivulets here and there like tears.
Donna pulled the flannel from her face and put it on the side of the bath.
She felt drained.
How she had ever managed to get back to  the Shelbourne, she didn't know.
It was as if her legs had turned to ice.
She could barely feel the pedals beneath her feet.
She'd left the smashed car outside and staggered inside, drawing disapproving glances from the other guests.
Once inside her room she'd called reception and told them to get the police.
She ordered herself a brandy and downed it a little too fast.
She'd been sitting on the edge of the bed when they'd arrived, two large uniformed men.
One of them looked at her as if she were mad as she recounted the story.
Donna smiled at the recollection.
Why shouldn't he think her mad?
The story sounded crazy enough.
The entire scenario had been insane.
Who would want to run her off the road the way the Audi had done?
No, he wasn't trying to run her off the road; he was trying to kill her.
Don't fuck about.
Face it.
Whoever was driving the car had been trying to kill her, it was as simple as that.
But why?
First the business with Mahoney, then the Audi.
What was going on?
The police had apologized for the incident as if they were personally to blame, their apologies becoming even more profuse as they told her that, without a number plate (which she had been unable to remember) to trace, there was little chance of them finding the car, let alone the driver.
Donna had nodded understandingly, anxious only then that they should go.
Alone in the room she had stripped naked and  run herself a bath, trying to wash away the sweat and relax after her ordeal.
She considered what she had discovered, her mind racing like a Roladex.
She was convinced now that her husband had been working on a book about The Hell Fire Club and…
And what?
That was it.
The only other things she had were guesses and suppositions.
He might have discovered a modern-day equivalent of the Club.
It's possible they killed him (even though the police in England were convinced his death was an accident).
Gordon Mahoney had gone, overnight, from being helpful to being downright rude.
Why?
Someone had tried to kill her that very morning.
Why?
Someone had broken into her house, apparently searching for something.
Why?
Questions.
But no answers.
Donna closed her eyes again.
Her husband had been having an affair with Suzanne Regan.
That was about the only other thing she knew for sure.
She wondered how the other woman was involved in this chain of events.
Had she been to these places with Chris?
Had he shared information with her he wouldn't share with his own wife?
Donna clenched her fists beneath the water.
The knowledge of his affair still ate away at her, and it was knowing that she could never speak to him about the affair that hurt most.
No, not hurt, angered her.
He had escaped her wrath when he died.
Both of them had.
They'd been wiped off the face of the earth before they could taste her fury.
That was what truly enraged her.
She sat up, splashing her face with water, catching a glimpse of herself in the steam-clouded mirror.
Her reflection looked distorted.
She hauled herself out of the bath, pulled on a bathrobe and wandered through into the sitting-room.
She picked up the phone and reached reception, asking them for the phone number of the Dublin National Gallery.
Perhaps if she could speak to Mahoney again, tell him what happened out by Mountpelier that morning, he would tell her more.
She got the number, thanked the receptionist then jabbed the digits, reading them carefully from her pad.
A voice told her she'd reached her chosen number.
‘Can I speak to Gordon Mahoney, please?’ she said.
She was asked to hang on for a moment.
Donna shifted the receiver to her other ear and began doodling on the pad.
The other voice returned.
Gordon Mahoney had gone home about an hour ago.
‘Could you give me his home number, please?’ she asked.
The voice at the other end of the line obliged and Donna pressed down on the cradle to sever the connection before ringing the new number.
She waited for the phone to ring at the other end.
Waited.
It was finally picked up.
‘Gordon Mahoney, please,’ she said.
Silence at the other end.
‘Hello.’
Nothing.
‘Gordon, it's Donna Ward.’
She heard the click as the phone was replaced.
‘Shit,’ she murmured and punched the same digits.
Dead line.
She heard nothing but the endless whine over the wire.
After a moment or two she replaced the receiver.
It was dusk by the time she checked out of the Shelbourne; night was approaching rapidly.
The sun left a red stain behind as it retreated below the horizon.
The taxi took her to the airport.
By the time the plane rose into the air it was dark.
Donna closed her eyes as it climbed through turbulence.
The flight to Edinburgh should take less than an hour.
Forty-Seven
The pistol was pressed against his cheek so hard that it almost broke the skin.
The sudden cold chill against his warm flesh woke him but, as Martin Connelly tried to sit up, shocked into consciousness by the sensation, the muzzle of the .45 was jammed against his face with incredible force.
In the darkness, and still half-asleep, he was unable to focus immediately on the figures standing around his bed.
All he was aware of was the deathly cold of the gun barrel.
For a fleeting second he wondered if he might be dreaming, but this time he had woken into a nightmare.
Connelly blinked myopically, trying to clear his gaze, trying to figure out what the hell was going on.
He felt his bowels loosen, felt the hairs on his neck and forearms prickle as he saw the face of the first intruder, the one who held the gun.
‘Get up,’ hissed Peter Farrell, stepping back.
He kept the gun pointed at Connelly's head the entire time, the barrel never more than inches from his face.
The muzzle seemed to expand, to grow into a vast black tunnel before his eyes.
‘Move,’ Farrell continued, grabbing Connelly  by one arm and jerking him towards the door of the bedroom.
The other man picked up the dressing gown lying on the end of the bed and threw it at Connelly.
He looked at Farrell as if asking permission to put it on, to cover his nakedness; although, at the moment, decency was the last of his worries.
Nevertheless he pulled it on and padded out onto the landing.
Farrell kept close by, the gun still held at his head.
‘I told you before I don't know anything,’ Connelly said quietly, his voice cracking.
His mouth felt dry, as if someone had filled it with sand.
Farrell grabbed the back of his hair and yanked his head back, forcing the gun hard against his temple.
‘I didn't believe you then and I don't believe you now.
I want some fucking answers,’ he hissed.
‘For Christ's sake…’
He was cut short by a shove in the back that nearly made him overbalance and fall down the stairs.
He shot out a hand and caught the banister, steadying himself.
On shaking legs he began to descend.
Farrell and the other man followed him.
‘Have you been in contact with the woman?’
Farrell wanted to know.
‘Which woman?’
‘Ward's widow, who do you think?’
‘Why should I have been?’
Farrell drove a foot hard into the base of Connelly's spine, the impact knocking him off balance.
He toppled forward, pitching off the steps.
He crashed against the wall then fell, rolled the last few stairs to the hallway.
Farrell was on him in an instant, dragging him upright, the gun held beneath his chin.
‘Have you been in contact with her?’ he repeated.
‘No,’ Connelly said, hurt by the fall.
‘Look, I swear to you, I don't know anything.’
Farrell pushed the agent's head back sharply, banging it against the wall with a sickening thud.
For a second Connelly thought he was going to pass out, but a hard smack across the face kept him conscious.
Farrell grabbed him by the shoulder and pushed him towards a closed door leading off the hallway.
‘What are you doing?’ said Connelly, realizing which room he was being shoved towards.
‘Move,’ snapped Farrell.
Connelly was about to push the door when it was opened from the inside and he found a third man there.
Farrell pushed the agent inside and was joined by the other intruder.
All four men stood in the room and Farrell raised the pistol once more so that it was aimed at the agent's head.
‘What the fuck are you playing at?’
Connelly babbled timorously.
‘We're not playing, Connelly,’ Farrell told  him and pulled him across the hot and clammy room.
The kitchen was large but the air was warm and dry.
Connelly didn't know how long the rings of the electric cooker had been on but one of them was almost white-hot.
Forty-Eight
‘No,’ Connelly shouted as he saw the glowing rings and felt their heat.
Farrell took a step towards him and swung the butt of the .45 hard, catching him across the forehead.
The agent went down heavily, a gash on his head weeping blood down the side of his face.
He rolled on the floor, moaning, and Farrell nodded to one of his companions.
‘Shut him up,’ he said.
The second man reached into his pocket and pulled out a long length of what looked like ribbon.
He slipped it around Connelly's chin and tugged it tight across his mouth, gagging him, then he dragged the agent upright.
The other man moved over to join them, gripping Connelly's right arm so that his hand was groping at empty air.
Farrell held the gun steady and looked directly at Connelly.
‘I'm only going to ask you these questions once,’ he said, ‘so listen.
When I ask you to answer, the gag will be removed.
If you attempt to shout for help, I'll kill you.
Do you understand?’
Connelly nodded, the action making his head ache.
Blood had begun to run into the corner of his eye and he blinked to try and clear his vision.
The heat from the cooker was intense and sweat already beaded his forehead and face.
‘Where is the book?’
Farrell said.
The gag was pulled free.
‘I don't know,’ Connelly said, his eyes filling with tears of terror.
‘I don't…’
The gag was pulled tightly back into position.
Farrell nodded.
The man holding Connelly's arm pushed it forward, forcing it down onto the largest of the electric rings, holding it there.
Searing, excruciating agony ripped through his hand and up his arm until it seemed to engulf his entire body.
His scream was muffled by the gag; the sound was like a child shrieking inside a locked room.
As the hand was held on the blazing ring, the stench of burning flesh was clearly noticeable in the hot air.
As the hand was finally pulled away, flesh stuck to the ring as if welded there by the heat.
Tiny pieces of skin shrivelled and cooked on the red-hot ring and wisps of smoke rose into the air.
Connelly felt himself losing consciousness but he was aware of being slapped hard across the face, even if the pain of the blow was negligible compared to the mind-numbing suffering he felt from his burned hand.
Blisters rose immediately, some of them in the shape of the ring.
He felt as if his entire arm and hand were ablaze; as if someone had turned a blowtorch on them.
‘Where's the fucking book?’
Farrell snarled, moving closer.
‘What did Ward do with it?’
‘I don't know,’ Connelly sobbed, tears mingling with the blood and sweat on his face.
There was a dark stain on his dressing gown and he could feel urine running freely down his leg.
‘Tell me,’ Farrell said, glaring at him.
‘He never told me about his work.
I swear on my fucking life I don't know where it is.’
His eyes bulged madly in their sockets, like bloodshot ping-pong balls threatening to burst from his skull.
‘I don't know anything about the book, I don't even think he'd started writing it.’
Farrell looked puzzled but merely nodded to his companion.
The gag was tugged back into place, cutting off Connelly's exhortations for mercy.
The muffled scream rose in his throat again as he felt the heat growing more intense, the closer to the blazing rings his hand was pulled.
Three inches.
He would rather died on the spot than endure that pain again.
Two inches.
The man tugged harder, using his immense strength to force Connelly's hand down towards the large ring.
One inch.
‘Where's the book?’
Farrell said again.
As his hand was crushed down onto the red-hot ring again, Connelly's body jerked convulsively and so savagely that the man holding him up was almost knocked off balance, but he stood his ground while his companion pressed down on the limb.
Blisters which had formed the first time now burst, weeping clear fluid onto the burner which hissed like an angry snake.
The whole hand turned a deep shade of scarlet, the flesh itself heating up.
Connelly, barely conscious now, felt as if his blood was boiling, as if his bones were calcifying under the incredible heat.
Pain hit him in one intolerable wave and he blacked out.
The mercy of unconsciousness was denied him; as one of the men slapped him while the other threw water from the tap over him, also tugging his hair in an effort to bring him round.
He awoke to screaming pain in his hand, which hung uselessly at his side.
The palm and most of his wrist were scorched black, the flesh seared into thick red welts.
And again there was that sickly sweet stench of cooked flesh which clogged his nostrils and made him want to vomit.
When his head lolled back, his hair was seized and tugged hard.
‘Last chance,’ Farrell said flatly.
‘Where's the book?’
Connelly was sobbing uncontrollably now.
‘You can't do this, please stop, Jesus fucking Christ, I don't know.
Oh God,’ he whimpered, tears pouring down his cheeks.
The man holding him tugged his hair and yanked his head back.
‘Ward hadn't even written the fucking book, I swear to God.’
Farrell pushed his companion aside and grabbed the agent by the throat, almost lifting him off his feet, staring right into his bulging eyes.
‘What do you mean he hadn't written the book?’ he said.
‘He was still researching it.’
‘He stole it.’
‘Stole what?’
Connelly babbled frantically.
‘He stole the book.
He took it from us.’
‘I don't know what you're talking about.’
‘Liar,’ snapped Farrell.
He pushed Connelly's head towards the cooker, determined to push his face against the blistering rings.
‘I don't know,’ he shrieked, the screams cut off by Farrell's free hand.
The muffled bellows were the only sounds he could make as his face was pushed closer and closer to the glowing rings.
He could smell his own burned flesh on them, could see blackened streamers of skin sticking to the metal.
‘Ward stole the book from us,’ Farrell said.
‘Where did he hide it?’
The heat was unbearable.
Connelly used every ounce of strength he had to push himself away from the cooker, but Farrell was a powerful man and forced the agent's face ever closer to the ring.
Another two inches and the burning cooker ring would be against his flesh.
‘Tell me where he hid it,’ Farrell urged.
One inch.
‘He doesn't know,’ said one of the other men, smiling thinly as he watched the agent struggle.
Connelly was fighting as hard as he could but it was useless.
The heat made him feel faint; as his face was moved closer, he could actually feel the blistering heat drying his eye.
It was over now.
Farrell suddenly yanked him upright, away from the cooker.
As he did he drove a fist hard into Connelly's face, the impact propelling him across the kitchen.
He slammed into a wall, his head snapping back to crack against the plaster, then he fell forward.
‘Bring him,’ Farrell said, nodding towards the door.
‘We're taking him with us.’
Forty-Nine
At first he thought they'd blinded him.
Martin Connelly was sure that his eyes were open, yet he could see nothing.
It took a few  seconds after he regained consciousness to realize that he was blindfolded.
The cloth had been knotted tightly round his head, cutting into his temples.
But the discomfort was mild compared to the pain which engulfed the rest of his body, filling his veins like liquid fire.
His head throbbed mightily from the blows he'd received, and the continuous agony of his burned hand made him feel as if the limb was swelling to gigantic proportions.
Soon it would simply burst.
Connelly flexed his fingers and toes and felt renewed pain, a feeling of weightlessness.
A terrible strain on his shoulders and neck.
as if …
He was suspended in mid-air, dangling there like a useless, discarded puppet.
He had no idea where he was and no idea how far off the ground he was.
It could be two or three inches, it could be several hundred feet.
Also, he was suddenly aware of the numbing cold.
As a cool breeze swathed his sweat-drenched body he realized they had taken his clothes.
Martin Connelly dangled naked in the air, supported only by two thick pieces of hemp, wound so tightly around his wrists that they chafed the skin raw.
Help me.
He noticed the smell.
A rank, fetid odour clogged his nostrils and reminded him of bad meat.
It seemed to be coming closer to him.
Perhaps the mad fuckers had hung him in an abattoir.
His mind began to  race, all the possibilities hurtling through his consciousness.
If he was hanging in a slaughterhouse, then might they not choose to use the implements of the slaughterer on him?
The cleaver.
The butcher's knife.
The skewers.
Connelly felt sick and tried to twist himself free, his legs swinging helplessly beneath him.
His ankles were unbound; it made him think he was higher off the ground than he would have liked.
Perhaps they reasoned that even if he managed to slip clear of the ropes he would have so far to fall it wouldn't matter.
The agent stopped struggling and hung there, aware of the pain in his wrists and the rasping against his skin, but even more conscious of the massive welts and blisters that covered his throbbing hand.
The silence was unbroken but for his own laboured breathing.
He let out an involuntary groan of pain and desperation.
‘Where is the book, Mr Connelly?’
The voice lanced through the blackness, close to him and below him to the right.
He looked in that direction but the blindfold prevented him from seeing who had spoken.
‘Where is it?’
Another voice.
This time below to his left.
It was like the first.
Slow, deliberate.
Slightly mucoid.
as if the speaker had a mouthful of phlegm.
‘The book.’
Connelly felt a sudden stab of fear and also of  quite irrational embarrassment.
The pain seemed to take a back seat momentarily, then he moved his right hand and it came thundering back into his mind.
‘Christopher Ward took it from us, you know that,’ the first voice said.
Connelly was aware of that rancid stench growing stronger.
It was closer to him now.
So close, he could feel breath on his thigh.
On the thigh.
That meant that, unless the one standing to his right was abnormally tall, he couldn't be suspended more than about six feet off the ground.
It was the only crumb of comfort he could salvage from the ordeal.
He clung to it.
‘We want to know what Ward did with the book.
We want it back,’ the second voice said.
‘We need it back,’ the first voice told him.
‘Where is it?’
Connelly cleared his throat.
‘I swear to you I don't know what book you're talking about,’ he said.
‘I know Ward was writing a book, but he hadn't even started it, he was still doing research.’
‘We don't care about the book he was going to write,’ the first voice snapped angrily.
‘We want back what is rightfully ours.’
‘He stole it and hid it somewhere.
We need to know where so we can recover it,’ the other voice added.
‘Tell me about the book,’ Connelly said, the last vestiges of reason working in his tortured  mind.
Could he possibly talk his way out of this situation?
‘I may be able to help.’
‘He doesn't know,’ the first voice said.
‘He's lying,’ said the second.
‘Ward was his client, he must have known,’ intoned a third voice.
A harsh voice that Connelly recognized as belonging to the tall man with the dark, close-cropped hair.
‘He knows where it is,’ Peter Farrell insisted.
‘I don't know anything about a stolen book,’ Connelly bleated.
‘Then you are no use to us,’ the first voice said.
‘Wait,’ Connelly said, panicking.
There was silence for a second, only his rapid breathing filling the air.
‘His wife knows where the book is,’ Connelly lied.
‘Find her and she'll lead you to it.’
Would they believe it?
Come on, convince them.
He realized that his last chance was to make his captors believe that Donna knew where the book they sought was hidden, whatever it was.
If they thought that she knew, they might let him go.
To hell with Donna.
He had to save himself.
‘Ward told her everything.
He would have told her where your book is,’ the agent continued, the lies falling easily from his lips.
‘Find her and you'll find the book.’
‘You're lying,’ snapped Farrell.
‘We didn't find it at Ward's house.’
‘Well, he wouldn't keep it there, would he?’
Connelly hoped they couldn't hear the desperation in his voice.
‘Besides, he owns another place, a cottage in Sussex.
It could be there.
Look, she's gone to look for it.
His wife is searching for the book because Ward told her he had it.
He told her he stole it.
It's her you want, not me.
She knows.’
‘Where is this house in Sussex?’
Farrell demanded.
Connelly searched his mind desperately, trying to remember.
He almost smiled when he did, quickly imparting the information to them.
‘It could be there but I doubt it.
She was going to Ireland to find it.
I asked her if she wanted me to go with her but she said no.
She said she had to find the book, but that it was a secret between her and Ward.
She's in Ireland now.’
‘She was,’ Farrell corrected him.
‘She was seen near the lodge at Mountpelier yesterday.’
‘I told you,’ Connelly blurted.
‘Shut up,’ hissed Farrell, striking him hard across the stomach.
‘Is this true?’ the first voice asked.
‘She was at the Lodge?’
‘She left on a plane from Dublin last night.
She's being followed,’ Farrell explained.
Merciful fucking Christ, I think I've done it.
They believe me, Connelly thought as he tried to suck in breath, tasting the rancid atmosphere as thickly as if it were smoke.
‘I told you,’ he said wearily.
‘She knows where it is.’
‘You would betray this woman to save yourself?’ asked the first voice.
A chuckle.
It was a sound that made the hair at the back of Connelly's neck rise.
‘You really have no honour, do you?
I like that.’
Another laugh.
And another.
The whole room seemed to be filled with it.
Raucous, insane laughter that drummed in the agent's ears until he feared he would go deaf.
It gradually died away.
His body swayed gently back and forth on the ropes.
‘I've helped you,’ he said.
‘Let me go, please.’
‘And if we do?
We are to expect you to keep quiet?
What do you think we are?’ the second voice snorted.
‘Your treachery is matched by your stupidity.
If we release you, you will try to expose us the way Ward was going to.’
‘How can I?’ bleated Connelly.
‘I haven't seen who you are.
Please.’
He felt hands tugging at his blindfold.
‘Look upon us,’ the voice said and the agent opened his eyes.
‘Oh God,’ he whispered as he stared at his captors, his eyes bulging madly.
He gaped round the small room, realizing that he was suspended from a ceiling only fifteen feet high.
There were a dozen or more people in the room, all seated, all staring at his dangling, vulnerable form.
‘You have been a help to us and now we are  done with you,’ said the first man, smiling up at him.
‘No,’ shouted Connelly.
He heard the sound of liquid slurping in a metal container as Farrell approached him from behind.
‘What are you doing?’ he shrieked, twisting about madly on the ropes that suspended him.
He felt cold, thick fluid being splashed on him.
He smelled the petrol as it covered his skin.
‘No,’ he bellowed.
‘For God's sake, please don't.
Please.’
His voice cracked as it rose in pitch.
More of the reeking petrol was doused over him.
It matted the hair on his chest and ran down over his pubic hair and penis, dripping from his feet.
Tears of helplessness and terror welled up in his eyes.
‘You can't do this, please,’ he wailed.
The first figure struck a match and held it up in front of him, the tiny yellow flame glowing brightly.
‘No,’ Connelly screamed, his yell so loud it seemed his lungs would burst.
‘Thank you for your help,’ said the figure, and tossed the match at him.
The petrol ignited immediately, a loud whump filling the room as it consumed Connelly's body, which twisted insanely on the ropes as he screamed in uncontrollable agony.
From those watching there was movement.
They stood and, as one, began to applaud.
There was some laughter.
Connelly's body continued to burn.
Fifty
It was raining outside, a thin veil of rain that was blown by the wind so that it appeared to undulate in the air like gossamer curtains.
Droplets of fluid formed on the window and trickled down, puddling on the sills.
Donna Ward glanced distractedly out of the window for a second, her mind racing, her hand on her book.
The pages were stiffened with age and the tome smelt fusty, like a damp cloth left to dry on a radiator.
Some of the words on the pages were faint, barely legible.
Donna had squinted at them as she'd read.
Some of the words did not even make sense to her but, through the confusion, she'd been able to salvage enough to piece together roughly the contents.
If not for the help of the librarian she might not even have found the book.
After checking into The Holiday Inn, Edinburgh, she had travelled to the library indicated in Ward's notes and diary, not really sure what she sought.
The library was large and, rather than hunt through the endless rows of volumes  dating as far back as 1530, she had sought the help of the librarian.
The woman was in her mid-thirties, dressed in a black trouser suit and white sweater.
She was a little overweight, her hands a touch too pudgy when she reached for various books and took them from the shelves.
The badge she wore on one lapel proclaimed that her name was Molly.
She seemed eager to help and selected half a dozen books for Donna to look at concerning The Hell Fire Club.
She herself knew little or nothing about the organisation, and Donna wished she could have happened upon someone as knowledgeable on the subject as Mahoney had been.
This time she was on her own.
There were only a handful of other people in the library reference section; the normal air of peace and quiet one would expect in such a place seemed to have become an unnatural silence.
Donna glanced round at the other occupants of the room but they were all hunched over their chosen books, seated at the wooden desks.
Every so often the sound of a dropped pencil or pen would break the solitude, but apart from that the only sound was that of the wind outside, whipping around the building, hurling rain at the windows so hard it sounded as if thousands of tiny pebbles were being bounced off the glass.
Donna returned to the book, bending closer to make out the words:
Initiates into these clubs did undertake to join in deeds most foule to Christian Man.
Some such as cannot bee described.
The Acts demanded of them were as different as those Clubs themselves.
Of the Clubs in existence there were the Mohocles The Blasters, The Bucks, The Bloods and, most vile of all The Sons of Midnight.
These Heathen groups practised rites som would pray God not to here.
Donna flicked ahead a few pages but could see no way of hastening her search for the information she sought.
She continued to read;
Those who joined were forced to fornicate in the presence of others.
Some would beat the women afterwards.
But these vile tasks were as welcome to them for they knew no love of God nor worship of Him.
Only the pleasure of the flesh and pleasing their Masters was their joy.
They killed too and found pleasure in it.
After fornication with a woman then the one who would join would show his love of the Unholy by taking a child and killing it.
The skull he would keep in his abode.
A sign and an offering to those he wanted to join.
Som would kill the unborn child or children of women and som ript open their bellys to take the child as offering.
The skull of that child would always be theres.
A sign of their villainy and proofe of their love of Evil.
Donna chewed her lip contemplatively as she read, forced to run her index finger beneath the words, so jumbled and irregularly formed were they on the faded page.
All these Evils are set down in great and Anciente Bookes called Grimoires.
These books much prized by thes societys were filld with incantations and secrets known only to those who trod the dark pathes.
Each club had a GRIMOIRE and where in every member would write his name as to show love of Evil and to show kinship with others of Evil.
Donna fumbled in her handbag, looking for a piece of paper and a pen.
She found a notepad from the Shelbourne and scribbled the word Grimoire down.
She wondered where they kept the dictionaries.
The hand on her shoulder made her jump.
She turned to see Molly standing there.
‘Sorry if I startled you,’ she said, smiling.
‘I just wondered how you were getting on.’
She nodded towards the books in front of Donna.
‘I'm okay,’ she said, her heart slowing slightly.
She administered herself a swift mental rebuke for nervousness.
‘I need a dictionary, please.’
Molly nodded and hurried off to fetch one, returning a moment later.
She handed it to Donna and stood by her as she flipped through it, running her finger down the columns of words until she found what she sought.
GRIMOIRE;(Archaic)(Grim-wah) Old Norman French word;(i) A Book of Spells and invocations.
(ii) A book supposedly used for contacting Devils and Demons.
Usually ascribed to Witches or Satanists.
She re-read the definition, then closed the book and handed it back to Molly who smiled.
‘Can I help you with anything else?’ she wanted to know.
Donna ran a hand through her hair and sighed wearily.
Her shoulders felt stiff and she could feel the beginnings of a headache gnawing at her skull.
‘No thanks,’ Donna said gratefully.
‘I think I've finished.’
She glanced at the books in front of her, then at her watch.
It was approaching 4.15 p.m.
She'd been in the library for close to four hours now.
All the reading and yet she wasn't even sure she'd made any progress.
Because she wasn't sure what she was looking for.
She knew more about The Hell Fire Club; she was certain that was what her husband had been working on.
She knew that members had to fornicate and kill a child to gain entry.
She knew that they relied on a book called a Grimoire for their contact with Evil.
Donna sat back.
In the cold light of day it all seemed so ridiculous.
Contact with Evil.
Hell Fire Club.
What had any of this to do with her husband's death or affair, she asked herself?
Perhaps she should be reading about infidelity instead of impiety.
Widowhood instead of Wizardry.
And yet there were things wrong somewhere.
Nagging doubts in her mind.
The police were convinced that her husband had not been murdered.
She wasn't convinced.
Why had masked men broken into her house?
What had they been looking for?
Who were the men in the photo with Chris?
Why did one of them look like a man who had supposedly been dead for over two hundred years?
Why had she been chased and nearly killed in Ireland?
Why had Mahoney withdrawn his offer to help so suddenly and unexpectedly?
Why?
Why?
Her life was turning into a series of unanswered questions.
Donna rubbed her eyes and got to her feet, picking up the piece of paper and putting it in her handbag.
On her way out of the library she thanked Molly for her help.
Donna hesitated on the steps of the library, looking out into the rain, seeing people caught in the downpour hurrying past.
The cold wind closed around her like an icy fist, chilling her to the bone.
There had to be an answer to all this somewhere.
She just wasn't sure where to find it.
Not yet.
Fifty-One
Julie Craig heard the car pull up in the driveway and hurried across to the landing window-to look out.
She saw the Jaguar parked there but couldn't make out the identity of its occupant.
The man was alone; he looked alternately towards the house and then down, as if searching for something on the dashboard.
She saw him rub one hand across his forehead, as if wiping away perspiration.
Still he remained seated behind the steering wheel of the Jag.
Should she go downstairs, outside and ask him what he wanted?
No.
Let him make the first move.
She was suddenly aware how ridiculous she was becoming.
Why should there be anything sinister about him?
She tried to think more rationally, to dismiss the darker possibilities from her mind, but after what had happened here in the past week or so she found the worrying thoughts came more easily.
After all, hadn't men broken into the house?
He might be one of them, come during the day to catch her off guard.
She watched as the man swung himself out of the car.
He was dressed in a suit that looked as if it needed pressing.
Indeed, as he shut the car door, he brushed at one sleeve as if to remove wrinkles as well as fluff.
She watched as he stood beside the car for a moment looking up towards the house.
She stepped back a pace and watched as he looked across at the Fiesta then at the house once more.
He began walking towards it and she saw that he had one hand inside his jacket, as if reaching for something.
She moved to the head of the stairs and looked down into the hallway, listening to his footsteps approaching the front door.
He rang the bell.
Julie froze, gripped the banister tightly and waited.
He rang again and waited.
She moved quickly but cautiously down the stairs and stood close to the front door, edging towards the spy-hole, squinting through it.
The man she saw on the other side was in his late thirties, his hair receding slightly, but what hair he did have was thick and lustrous and reached the collar of his shirt.
He was thin-faced, a little pale.
He shifted from one foot to the other as he waited for the door to be answered.
As Julie saw him reach for the doorbell a third time she opened the door and eased it back to the extent of the chain.
The man peered through the gap and smiled politely at her.
‘Good morning,’ he said.
‘I'm sorry to disturb you.
I was wondering if I could speak to Mrs Ward.
Mrs Donna Ward.’
Julie eyed him suspiciously for a moment.
‘My name is Neville Dowd,’ he continued.
‘Sorry, I should have introduced myself first.’
He smiled warmly.
There seemed to be no threat in his manner.
Julie nodded a greeting.
‘I was Mr Ward's solicitor,’ he explained.
‘Can I help you?’
Julie wanted to know.
‘I needed to speak to Mrs Ward, actually.
I should have called round sooner but I've been on holiday and only returned yesterday to hear the news.
It must be a very difficult time for her.
I was going to call her into my office but I thought that would be a little heartless.’
He smiled thinly, as if expecting praise for his gesture of concern.
Julie nodded.
‘That's very good of you,’ she said, some of her initial apprehension disappearing.
‘May I ask who you are?’ he said.
‘I'm Donna's sister, Julie Craig.’
He extended a hand, tried to shake hers through the gap in the door.
Julie slipped the chain and opened the door to its full extent.
‘Sorry for the greeting,’ Julie said, ‘but you can't be too careful.’
‘I agree.
A woman here in a house like this, I  don't blame you being wary.
Is Mrs Ward here, please?’
‘She's away for a couple of days.
Can I give her a message?
I could get her to ring you when she gets back.’
Dowd looked perplexed.
‘No, it's all right.
Thank you, anyway.
I don't want to keep intruding; she must have other things on her mind.
It's just that there were some things I needed to clear up with her about her husband's estate.
Some items I'd been holding for him.
She should have them.’
‘What kind of items?’
‘I really shouldn't discuss that with anyone else but Mrs Ward.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude.’
‘I understand.’
He looked down at his shoes which, unlike his suit, looked well-cared for.
‘However, if you're not sure when she's going to be back…’
He allowed the sentence to trail off.
‘As long as she gets the items, that's all that matters.
If you'd be so kind, you could pass them on to her from me.
If she needs to get in touch with me for anything, she has my number.’
Julie nodded.
Dowd reached inside his jacket and pulled out a thick brown envelope.
He handed it to Julie.
‘Mr Ward said that this was only to be given to his wife in the event of his death,’ the solicitor said.
‘I'll see she gets it.’
Dowd extended a hand which Julie shook.
‘Thank you for your help.
Please pass on my condolences and tell her to call me if she needs any help.’
He smiled, told Julie how delightful it had been to meet her and headed back to his car.
She watched him slide behind the wheel of the Jag and start up the powerful engine.
He turned the vehicle round in the drive and drove off.
Julie closed the door again and slid the chain into place.
She lifted the envelope, testing its weight, then she moved across to the phone.
Running her finger down the notepad beside it, she found the number she sought and pressed the digits.
At the other end it began to ring.
Fifty-Two
6.46 p.m.
Julie cradled the mug of tea in both hands and looked at the wall clock on the other side of the kitchen.
She checked her own watch.
‘Con.e on,’ she murmured irritably.
The phone on the wall close to her rang and she picked it up at the second ring.
‘Donna?’ she said.
‘Yes,’ the voice at the other end said.
‘What kept you?
I called this morning.’
‘I've only just got back to my room and picked up your message.
What's wrong?’
‘Nothing, as far as I know.
I've had a visitor today.
Chris's solicitor, a man called Neville Dowd.
Do you know him?’
‘I met him a couple of times.
What did he want?’
Julie looked at the envelope lying on the worktop.
She told Donna about it.
‘What's in it?’
Donna asked.
‘It's private.
You didn't expect me to open it, did you?’
Julie said, surprised.
‘You'll have to look when you get back.
How's it going, by the way?’
Donna told her sister what had happened in Ireland, the information she'd accumulated about The Hell Fire Club and also what she'd found in the library in Edinburgh.
She explained a little about The Hell Fire Club itself.
‘So that's what Chris was working on?’
Julie said finally.
‘Who the hell were the men who attacked you in Ireland?’
‘I don't know.
I don't know if it's linked to Chris's work either.’
‘Can't the police do anything?’
‘They can't act on maybes, Julie.
I haven't got any concrete proof to show them.’
‘Someone tried to kill you; how much more concrete does proof have to be?’
‘Listen, I've been thinking about Chris's work.
You know how deeply involved he got with it; he had on other books.
I think he might have  discovered some kind of organisation like The Hell Fire Club.
A modern day off-shoot of it.
I'm not sure.’
‘Then why didn't he go to the police if he had?’
‘I don't know.’
Donna sighed.
‘I don't know what he was trying to do.
I don't know if she was involved with it.’
‘Who?’
‘Suzanne Regan.’
‘For Christ's sake, Donna, I thought you'd forgotten about that.’
‘Forgotten about it?
My husband dies in a car crash with his mistress and you think I can forget about it?’
‘I meant about his love life.
I thought you were supposed to be finding out what he was working on, not going on about what he might or might not have done with Suzanne Regan.’
‘I think she was involved with it, too,’ Donna said.
‘How?’
‘Some of the things I found out from books here today.
I think Chris was using her to get himself accepted into the organisation, whatever it was.’
‘You mean he was trying to join them?’
‘It's possible.
She could have been his way in.’
‘What would he have gained by joining a group like that?’
‘That's what I have to find out.
I thought Martin Connelly might know, but I've phoned his office and his home a couple of times and  there's never anyone there.
Have you heard from him?’
‘Why would he call me?’
Julie said defensively.
‘He might want to find out if I was back yet.
If he does call, tell him I'll speak to him when I get back.’
There was a pause, then the silence was finally broken by Donna.
‘I think Chris was involved in something, Julie.
Something dangerous.
Perhaps that envelope Dowd brought round will answer some questions.’
Julie looked at the envelope lying on the worktop.
‘There's nothing more for me here,’ said Donna wearily.
‘I'm coming home tonight.
I'll get a shuttle flight.’
‘Do you want me to pick you up from the airport?’
‘No, I'll get a cab.
I'll see you later.
Take care.’
‘You too.’
Donna hung up.
Julie gently replaced the receiver and walked across to the envelope.
She picked it up, feeling the weight of it.
It was packed tightly with papers and…
She ran her fingers gently over the manila surface and felt the outline of something small and cold inside.
She pressed it with the tip of her index finger, trying to figure out what it could be.
She frowned, gliding the pads of her fingers across the shape like a blind person reading braille, feeling every contour.
Fifty-Three
‘She must die.’
The voice floated through the air like smoke, the words almost visible in the heavy atmosphere.
‘Not yet,’ another said.
‘Not until we have the book.’
The room was large, the walls oak-panelled on two sides.
The other two were dark brick.
Paintings hung on them, large canvases in gilt frames.
The room was lit by a number of small reading lamps, none powered by anything stronger than a sixty-watt bulb.
It gave the room an artificially cosy feel, which was added to by the open fireplace and the array of expensive leather furniture that dotted the floor, spread out on thick carpet as dark as wet concrete.
The air was thick with cigarette and cigar smoke; a number of the twelve men seated there puffed away quite happily while they talked.
They sat at different places in the room, most of them also with drinks cradled in their hands.
The house in Conduit Street was just two minutes walk from Berkeley Square in one direction and, in the other, the bustling thoroughfare that was Regent Street.
The house and the room within were like a peaceful island in  the sea of activity that constituted the centre of London.
The room was on the second floor of the three-storey building, its curtains drawn, its inhabitants hidden from those below.
Windows like blind eyes reflected the lights of passing cars.
One of the men in the room got to his feet and crossed to a well-stocked drinks cabinet, refilling his glass, offering the same service to his colleagues.
They had been drinking for the best part of an hour but none were drunk.
Even so, large quantities of brandy and gin were consumed as the men talked.
There was a large table in the centre of the room, made of dark polished wood.
Two men sat at its head, their faces reflected in the gleaming surface.
As the first of them drank, the gold ring on his left index finger clinked against the crystal.
‘What if Connelly was lying?’ said the one seated next to him.
‘What if the woman doesn't know where the book is?’
‘She knows,’ the other said with an air of certainty.
‘She was at Rathfarnham, wasn't she?
She went to the lodge at Mountpelier.’
‘I want to know why she wasn't stopped there,’ an angry voice from the other side of the room interrupted him.
‘Those responsible for the mistake have been dealt with,’ another said.
‘Besides, we can't kill her until she's led us to the book or at least told us where we can find it.’
‘If Ward did tell her about it then she might go to the police,’ a third voice said.
‘Let her,’ chuckled another.
Several others joined in the laughter.
One of the men at the head of the table brought his hand down hard on the table-top and the sound ceased.
‘Enough of this.
We need the book and we need it quickly.
There isn't much time left.’
‘We'll get it,’ said another man, approaching the table.
‘We'll get her and the book.’
The other occupants of the room gradually moved across to the table, each of them taking a seat around it.
‘It must be in our hands within seven days,’ one of the men wearing the gold rings insisted angrily.
‘It will be.’
There was a note of certainty in Peter Farrell's voice.
‘I hope for your sake that it is, Farrell.
I hope for all our sakes it is.’
‘What if she uses the book the way Ward was going to?’ another voice added with concern.
‘If she knew about the book, he may have told her about the contents, too.’
Farrell waved a hand dismissively.
‘She's being followed now.
There are two men on her.
They'll find the book.
They'll make her tell them where it is.
And then they'll kill her.
End of story.’
‘What if they fail?’ a worried voice interjected.
‘They won't,’ Farrell snapped irritably.
‘You said that about the men who went to her house to search.
They failed.
Perhaps we underestimated her.’
‘She's a woman,’ Farrell chuckled.
‘Just a woman.’
A chorus of laughter greeted his remark.
‘So, we are agreed,’ said one of the men at the head of the table.
‘Once she tells us where the book is or she leads us to it, she dies.’
He looked around at his companions.
‘Yes?’
He looked at each man in turn and waited for their compliance.
They nodded slowly, solemnly, like a jury passing sentence.
Farrell merely smiled.
‘Perhaps we should have brought her here,’ said one of the men.
‘Let her enjoy our company for an evening.
There was more laughter.
One of the men at the head of the table rose, his glass in his hand, the gold of his ring clinking against the crystal.
‘A toast,’ he said grandly.
‘To the Death of God, the destruction of morality and to The Sons of Midnight.’
Francis Dashwood spoke the words with a grin on his wrinkled features.
Beside him, Richard Parsons echoed the toast, and so did the other men in the room.
‘To The Sons of Midnight.’
Fifty-Four
The shuttle flights from Edinburgh to London were booked up right through until eleven that evening.
Donna rang the station and discovered that there was a train to King's Cross leaving at 8.27 p.m.
She booked a seat on it and took a taxi to the terminus.
Trains out of Waverley were running fifteen minutes late by the time she got there, but she didn't care.
She wandered across the concourse to the Travellers' Fare buffet and sat warming her hands around a cup of coffee while she waited for her train to arrive.
She sat in the window, watching the streams of people coming to and from the trains.
Taxis waited in a long queue to ferry them away, while others struggled up the stairs with cases or bags, determined to make their way by other means.
She wondered how many of them were going home.
Home to relatives, to loved ones.
To husbands?
Donna felt a twinge of sadness and stared down into the depths of her cup, picking up the spoon and stirring unnecessarily, watching the dark liquid drip from the plastic utensil.
On the concourse people stood around gazing up at the departure and arrival boards, checking  times of trains.
She saw a young man squatting on a rucksack, eating a bar of chocolate and looking at the board.
Close by a couple were kissing, holding each other close to ward off the cold wind that had sprung up.
Donna watched them for a moment, then looked away.
One of the station employees was following a discarded wrapper across the concrete, trying to pick it up but thwarted every time by a fresh breeze that blew the litter out of his reach.
Cursing, he continued his pursuit.
Donna finally got to her feet and wandered outside, glancing up at the board, noticing that her train was due in about five minutes.
She left the buffet and headed for the small John Menzies shop opposite.
She didn't notice the thick-set man dressed in jeans and a long dark coat get up and follow her out.
He stood by the exit, watching, cupping one hand around the flame of his lighter as he lit up a Marlboro.
Donna glanced at the paperbacks on the bestseller stand as she entered the shop.
Only six months earlier her husband's last book had occupied a prominent position on that stand and hundreds like it up and down the country.
Again she felt that twinge of sadness.
She selected three magazines, paid for them, then made her way back out onto the concourse.
The man outside the buffet sucked on his cigarette and watched her as she headed towards the gates and the platforms beyond.
She paused  to roll up the magazines and push them into her handbag, rummaging for her ticket.
The man in the long dark coat glanced at Donna, then back towards the Menzies shop.
Another man, dressed in a leather jacket and trousers that were too short, was walking briskly across the concourse, his eyes fixed on Donna.
In fact so engrossed with her movements was he that he bumped into a young woman who was struggling with an impossibly heavy suitcase.
He almost knocked her over but continued walking, ignoring her angry shouts.
Other heads turned towards the commotion; indeed, even Donna looked round briefly.
But she only saw the girl who had now returned her full attention to the case.
Other passengers for the train were forming a queue.
Donna joined it, filing past the barriers, showing her ticket and heading down the platform towards the First Class carriages.
As she passed the buffet car her stomach rumbled, as if to remind her she hadn't eaten since lunchtime.
She opened one of the doors and climbed up, selecting a double seat for herself, sliding her suitcase between two seats.
Further down the train the man in the long dark coat also climbed aboard.
The man in the leather jacket stood on the platform for a moment longer before stepping up into the carriage next to Donna's.
She spread her magazines out on the table and removed her shoes, massaging her toes as she  waited for the train to pull away.
There were perhaps half a dozen other passengers in the carriage, all spread out.
Some read newspapers; one fiddled with a Walkman, adjusting the volume.
Donna shivered slightly, noticing how cold it was on the train.
The journey should take a little over six hours.
She glanced at her watch as the train pulled away from the platform.
The man in the leather jacket walked to the door that linked the carriages and looked through, seeing where Donna was seated.
Satisfied he knew her position, he returned to his seat.
There was plenty of time.
Fifty-Five
Apart from Donna there were only two other people eating in the train's dining car.
They sat at the far end of the carriage, talking in hushed tones.
Each man had a portable phone on the table beside him.
Donna enjoyed her meal, luxuriating in the warmth of the carriage.
She felt tired and wondered if she might manage a couple of hours' sleep before the train reached London.
It was about forty miles from York at present, so she had plenty of time.
She glanced up briefly as David Ryker passed  her, his leather jacket undone.
As he passed by, Donna noticed that his trousers didn't touch the top of his shoes.
She looked at his broad back, then at the short trousers, and smiled to herself, returning her attention to her coffee.
When the steward returned with a steaming pot she had another cup.
Ryker passed her once more, glancing at her, cradling a plastic beaker of tea in his hand.
As the train thundered over a set of points he steadied himself against her seat for a moment, then wandered off down the aisle.
Donna ordered brandy from the steward and sat gazing at the window of the train.
Apart from lights from distant towns, all she saw was her own reflection in the dark glass.
The train sped along, countryside flying by in the gloom outside.
She moved across to the window, cupping one hand over her eyes so that she could see out, but there was little to see.
They passed through a small station and she caught a glimpse of a couple of people standing on the windswept platform, but other than that there was nothing to see.
She sat back and reached for her brandy.
She closed her eyes and allowed her head to loll back against the pillow.
Was she any closer to a solution, to finding out why her husband had died?
He died because his car hit a wall.
But why?
Was it really an accident?
The incidents in Ireland told her it wasn't, yet  she had no proof to support the fact that he had been killed.
She was beginning to wonder if her trip had been worthwhile.
She had also wondered if seeing the places he went might make her feel closer to him, but it hadn't.
She was left with still more unanswered questions.
Most of all, she was no wiser as to his involvement with Suzanne Regan.
Donna missed Chris badly.
At nights, particularly, she had felt loneliness so great it was as if a hole had been torn in her soul, something irreplaceable had been ripped from her.
Knowing of his involvement with another woman, however, had meant that that hole was in danger of being filled with hate, not sorrow.
If only she'd had the chance to ask him why he'd had the affair.
She felt cheated, when she should have felt despair.
Just one chance to ask him.
One chance to say goodbye.
She sat forward and opened her eyes.
David Ryker's reflection filled the window beside her as he passed.
For a second Donna thought he'd been standing there looking at her, this man in the leather jacket and trousers which were too short.
He retreated back down the aisle again.
Donna decided to take her brandy back to her seat with her.
She paid the bill and walked back through the dining car, drawing glances from the two men at the other end with the portable phones.
Both of them looked at her  for a second, then continued their hushed conversation.
She made her way back to her seat, noticing that the man with the leather jacket was seated about five rows behind her.
Donna made herself comfortable and prepared to sleep, wondering, despite the fact that she was tired, whether or not the thoughts tumbling through her mind would be still long enough to allow her two or three precious hours' rest.
She drained what was left in her glass and set it down.
‘Mind if I join you?’
The voice startled her.
She looked round to see Ryker standing there.
His face was expressionless.
Without waiting to be invited he sat down beside her and crossed his legs, the trousers riding up almost to his calf.
‘I saw you in the dining car,’ he said.
‘I thought you were travelling alone.’
‘I prefer travelling alone,’ Donna said, trying to be as tactful as possible.
She smiled thinly at him.
‘Can I get you a drink?’
Ryker asked.
‘I was going to have one.’
‘No thanks, I was going to try and get some sleep,’ she told him, an edge to her voice.
‘I can't sleep on trains,’ Ryker said.
And it doesn't look as if I'm going to be able to either, thought Donna irritably.
‘I get bored,’ he continued, looking up, noticing that another man was approaching.
A man in a long dark overcoat.
Donna saw him, too.
Saw that he was looking at her.
She sat up, the puzzled look on her face turning to one of irritation.
The second man sat opposite her.
‘I don't want to seem rude,’ she said, ‘but I was hoping to travel on my own.
I…’
Ryker cut her short.
‘Shut up,’ he whispered.
‘Just shut it.’
Donna turned to say something to him.
As he opened his jacket she saw his hand close over the hilt of a knife.
Opposite, the man in the long dark overcoat was smiling.
‘We need to ask you some questions,’ he said.
‘We need your help.’
He unbuttoned his coat and reached inside.
‘And what if I call for the steward?’
Donna said defiantly.
Stuart Benton pushed back his coat slightly so that she could see that he too carried a knife.
‘If you do,’ he said softly, leaning towards her, ‘we'll slice you up like a joint of meat.’
Fifty-Six
‘Who are you?’
Donna regarded the two men warily, her  gaze flicking from one to the other in quick succession.
‘We need your help,’ said Benton, staring at her.
‘And you're going to give it.
You're going to tell us what we want to know.’
Donna looked up and saw the steward coming up the aisle.
Could she alert him to her danger?
Should she?
Ryker saw him too and nodded towards him.
Benton glanced over his shoulder and saw the man.
‘Don't even think about it,’ he said, his eyes blazing.
‘I'll kill him, too.’
The steward smiled as he passed, glancing at the two men sitting close to Donna.
Benton watched him go.
‘Well done, Mrs Ward,’ he said, smiling.
‘Don't patronize me, you bastard,’ she snarled.
‘And how do you know my name?’
‘We've been following you since you left your hotel yesterday,’ Ryker told her.
‘The library, everywhere.’
‘Was the book in the library?’
Benton said.
‘There's lots of books in libraries, you half-wit.
You should try looking some time,’ Donna said with gleeful malice.
‘You fucking cunt…’
Benton snapped, lunging forward.
Donna sat back in her seat, her heart thudding hard against her ribs.
But it was Ryker who sat forward to restrain his companion.
‘We can't hurt her,’ he said quickly, hoping Donna hadn't heard.
‘Farrell said not to hurt her yet.’
‘Bitch,’ hissed Benton.
‘Fucking rich bitch.’
He nodded slowly.
‘Mouthy, just like your old man.’
‘You knew my husband?’ she asked.
‘I saw him a couple of times.
Flash cunt.
Thought he owned the place.
Too much mouth.’
‘Did you kill him?’ she wanted to know.
‘No,’ said Benton, ‘but I wish I had.
Perhaps I'll have to make do with killing his missus.
Now, tell us where the book is.
Are you going to pick it up now?’
‘I don't know what book you're talking about,’ she said.
The steward passed by again and Donna even managed to smile at him.
She felt suddenly more secure despite the fact that she was flanked by men with knives.
The train wasn't stopping until it got to London; there were other people in the carriage and surely these men wouldn't dare try anything here, now.
If they harmed her there was no way they could get off the train other than jumping and, with it travelling at over ninety-five miles an hour, that didn't seem a very good idea.
If she could call their bluff she might just be able to slip away.
Play for time.
She knew she had to keep her nerve.
Easier said than done.
‘Do I take it that you work for the same  man as the two who broke into my house?’ she asked.
Benton looked at his companion, who merely wrinkled his brow.
‘I mean, they seemed to be incompetent morons like you.
It's an understandable supposition.
Don't you agree?
Or would you prefer me to stick to words of one syllable?’
Benton leaned forward again, his face contorted with anger.
‘I'm going to enjoy doing you,’ he said angrily.
‘I might even slip you one before I do.’
He rubbed one hand across his groin.
‘Right up your tight, rich twat.’
‘And what do you think the other passengers are going to do?
Just look the other way?’
‘You think anyone's going to help you?
Do you think anyone gives a fuck what happens to you?
Nobody cares.
They'll be too busy looking after themselves,’ Benton hissed.
He and Donna locked stares for long moments.
‘Where's the book?’
Ryker said, jabbing her in the ribs with his elbow.
‘Get off me,’ Donna hissed.
‘Where is it?’ he asked, jabbing her again.
She tried to move away from him.
‘Come on, bitch.
Tell us.’
‘Fuck you,’ said Donna and kicked out hard under the table.
Her foot connected hard with Benton's right shin and he yelped in pain, reaching down to massage the throbbing limb.
Ryker jabbed her again with his elbow.
‘Where is it?’ he persisted.
‘I'm going to fucking cut you,’ Benton said, wincing in pain.
‘I don't care what Farrell says.’
He leaned closer.
‘Get on your fucking feet, we're going for a walk.’
‘I'm not moving from here,’ Donna told him, meeting his steely gaze and holding it.
‘Get up,’ Benton repeated.
‘I'll kill you, I swear I will.’
‘You can't kill her,’ Ryker reminded him.
‘Farrell…’
‘Fuck Farrell,’ he grunted.
‘We'll tell him she made a run for it, we had no choice.’
‘He wanted her alive,’ Ryker persisted.
Benton pulled the knife free of his belt, leant forward and touched the blade to Donna's left knee.
She felt the point against her stockinged leg.
‘If you're not on your feet in five seconds I'll open your leg to the bone.
You got that?’
Donna regarded him blankly for a moment, then nodded.
She stood up and squeezed past Ryker, picking up her handbag in the process.
Throwing it over her shoulder, she set off down the aisle, the two men close behind her.
As she passed the steward she nodded.
He returned the gesture, looking at her two new companions.
Donna swallowed hard.
As long as she was on the train she was safe.
Well, reasonably safe, anyway.
There were  other passengers around.
What could they do to her?
The lights flickered briefly as the train entered a tunnel.
Donna kept on walking, aware that her two unwanted attendants were no more than a foot or so behind her.
The buffet car was up ahead; there was a young woman buying a drink and some sandwiches.
Donna passed her, squeezing by.
Ryker and Benton followed.
As they reached the area between two carriages Benton told her to stop.
He pushed her towards the door, then reached into his coat pocket and took out a packet of cigarettes.
He lit one, standing beside Donna, blowing smoke out of the window.
Cold night air rushed in, ruffling her hair and making her eyes water.
What to do?
Ryker was standing by the door to the compartment, watching both ways for anyone approaching.
‘Now, we'll start again,’ Benton said, gripping Donna's wrist in one powerful hand.
‘Where's the book?’
‘I don't know,’ she told him, trying to shake loose.
Benton leaned closer so that his face was only inches from hers.
‘Have you ever seen anyone stabbed?’ he said, spittle flying into her face.
‘Do you know how much knife wounds can bleed?’
Donna pressed herself against the wall in a bid to move away both from his presence and his foul-smelling breath.
‘I have to go to the toilet,’ she said.
‘What, so you can get in there and pull the emergency cord?
Fuck off.’
‘Then I'll have to piss all over your shoes, won't I?’
Donna said defiantly.
Benton moved back slightly, then his lips curled into a crooked smile.
‘You can go,’ he told her.
‘I'll stand in there with you.
To make sure you don't come to any harm.’
He chuckled and pushed open the lavatory door for her.
‘Keep an eye open,’ he told Ryker, pushing Donna into the small cubicle in front of him and pulling the door shut behind.
‘Benton,’ said his companion, grabbing the other man's arm.
‘Don't kill her.
I mean it.’
‘I'll handle this.’
‘Well then, you'll have to handle Farrell if you kill her.
He said he didn't want her harmed until we find out what she knows about the book.
Just go fucking steady, will you?’
Benton shook loose.
‘And you just keep your eyes peeled.
Right?’
There was scarcely room for one inside the cubicle, let alone two.
Donna found the big man pressed close to her.
‘What are you going to do?
Stand there and watch me?’ she demanded.
‘I'm not going to turn my back on you, if that's what you were hoping.
Go on, get on with it.
Or  do you want a hand?’
He chuckled.
‘I'll close my eyes, how's that?’
He did.
It was only a split second but it was all Donna needed.
She lashed out with her right foot, driving it into Benton's groin with all the power she could muster.
She actually felt the bottom of his pelvic bone thump against her foot as she slammed his testicles up against the bone.
He howled in pain, the sound lost as the train hurtled into a tunnel.
Donna lunged at him, aware that his face was unprotected as he clutched at his genitals with both hands.
She raked his face with her nails, digging at his eyes, making him scream in renewed agony as she sheared a portion from his lower eyelid.
Blood ran down his face.
He tried to fight back, clutching at her throat and digging his thumbs into her Adam's apple, but she bit into his thumb until she drew blood, kicking again at the big man.
She drove three kicks into his shins and smashed her handbag into the side of his head.
Possessed of a strength born of fear and rage, she rained blows onto him, pushing him against the lavatory door, which flew open.
His face scratched and bleeding, contorted in a grimace of pain and anger, Benton toppled backwards, one hand reaching for the knife.
The train was still inside the tunnel, the wind howling like a mad banshee through the  open windows.
The lights flickered on and off.
Donna threw herself clear of Benton's groping hands.
She spun round and brought one heel down with tremendous force onto his outstretched hand.
The point of the heel crushed the tip of his index finger, splitting the nail as far as the cuticle.
Blood burst from the shattered digit and Benton screamed again.
Donna turned as Ryker came at her, avoiding his clumsy attempts to grab her.
She was not so lucky with Benton, who sprang up and crashed into her, his arms locking around her waist, their combined momentum slamming them against the door.
The impact caused it to fly open.
For what seemed like an eternity both of them were suspended in mid-air, filthy fumes pouring into the carriage from inside the tunnel.
Then the second passed.
Ryker tried to grab them but was too late.
They toppled out.
Fifty-Seven
She knew she was going to die.
In that split second, as she and Benton fell from the train, Donna knew.
The stench of the tunnel filled her nostrils; the roar of the train drummed in her ears.
She felt weightless as they pitched into empty air.
Benton, in his terror, released his grip on her waist.
His scream echoed madly inside the tunnel as he fell was slammed against the brickwork then bounced back against the speeding train, his body pulped by the impact.
Something inside Donna's mind, some shred of self-preservation, made her shoot out a hand.
She managed to grip the frame of the window on the door which was flying open now, banging against the side of the train.
Hold on, her mind screamed.
Hold on.
She used all her strength to grip the frame, her body buffeted by the high-speed wind that swept against the train as it roared along.
Her hair whipped around her face; she felt the icy chill filling her.
Her fingers were beginning to go numb.
She was losing her grip.
The train burst free of the tunnel and Donna shouted in defiance, managing to get her other hand onto the frame, too.
But all she could do was hang there from the side of the speeding train, unable to move, knowing her strength would eventually fade.
It was only a matter of time before she fell.
‘Grab my hand,’ roared Ryker, extending a hand.
‘I'll pull the door shut.’
He gripped the open door and pulled, one of his hands closing over Donna's.
She had visions of him slowly unpeeling her fingers, prising them from the door until she fell.
But instead he used all his strength to heave the door shut, battling against the onrushing wind as the train continued to hurtle along.
Donna felt faint; she thought her grip was failing.
HOLD ON.
Ryker pulled the door another few inches, pulled her closer.
If only she could hang on…
She felt her feet trailing through the weeds that grew at the side of the track, nettles and thistles tearing her skin as she was dragged through them at high speed.
‘Take my hand,’ Ryker shouted, bellowing to make himself heard.
‘I'll pull you in.’
Donna didn't have time to think.
She hadn't the luxury of considering her options.
She gripped his hand as tightly as she could, feeling a terrific wrench on her shoulders as he tried to haul her in, steadying himself against the door to ensure that he didn't end up suffering the same fate as his companion.
‘Your other hand,’ he shouted.
‘Give me your other hand.’
She had one hand clamped in Ryker's, the other wrapped round the door frame.
If she relinquished her grip on the door she was completely at his mercy.
‘Come on,’ Ryker screamed at her.
There was another tunnel approaching, looming large and dark, ready to swallow her and the train.
She heard a loud roar and realized that the 125 was sounding its air horn.
A warning as it entered the tunnel.
She looked ahead, saw the yawning black mouth and the dark hillside around it.
Saw the lights.
Lights which got brighter as they came closer.
There was another train coming the other way on the track next to her.
It would leave the tunnel as her own train entered.
There would be less than five feet between the massive engines.
She would be crushed between them.
Donna let go of the door and allowed Ryker to grab her other hand.
He pulled as the two trains drew closer.
‘Come on,’ he screamed and heaved her upwards, clutching at her dress to pull her inside while she held his arms, squirming her legs through the window.
They both fell in an untidy heap on the floor.
The other train swept past with a roar and a deafening hiss of air.
Then it was gone.
Donna rolled onto her back, her eyes half-closed, her limbs numb.
She could feel nothing but the cold, that seemed to have filled every pore of her body.
Her ankles and shins were  scratched and bloodied, her stockings shredded by the trackside weeds and nettles.
Ryker knelt beside her, shook her, rubbed her arms as if trying to restore the circulation.
She was still cold.
Numbingly, almost painfully cold and some of it was shock.
‘Why did you save me?’ she said quietly, looking at Ryker.
‘Because I need you alive,’ he said, still rubbing her arms.
‘I need information from you.’
He looked worried.
‘Who are you?’ she slurred, close to fainting.
He struck her hard across the face to prevent that.
Then she felt his arms beneath her shoulders, lifting her, pushing her into the lavatory, locking it behind him.
He sat her on the seat and stood looking down at her.
She glanced up and saw the knife hidden inside his jacket.
A thought occurred to her and she almost smiled.
Out of the frying pan into the fire.
Don't all laugh at once.
Donna rubbed both hands across her face, her body quivering as she began to regain some warmth, some feeling in her extremities.
Her shoulders ached; her hands and legs were throbbing.
‘I saved your life,’ said Ryker.
‘Now tell me what I want to know.’
She closed her eyes.
The banging on the door made her open them again.
Fifty-Eight
‘Conductor,’ the voice outside called.
Ryker shot an angry glance at Donna and mouthed something she couldn't make out.
She held his gaze then called, ‘Just a minute.’
Ryker looked at her with sheer hatred.
For one terrible second she thought he was reaching for the knife.
‘Open it,’ she whispered, nodding towards the door.
‘I'll kill you and whoever's outside that door,’ Ryker said.
‘You wanted me alive, you said,’ Donna told him defiantly.
‘Kill me and you don't get your information.
Now open the door.’
They glared at each other for a second longer, then Ryker turned the lock and pushed the door open.
The conductor looked in on them, eyebrows raised.
‘What the hell is this?’ he said irritably, seeing the two dishevelled occupants of the lavatory.
‘What's going on?’
He saw the cuts and scratches on Donna's legs.
‘I've heard about this sort of thing before,’ he said, as if realizing what he'd  stumbled on, or at least what he thought he'd stumbled on.
‘Very funny.
I know what you've been up to.
Another couple tried it on one of my trains a month or so ago.
I caught them, too.’
‘It isn't what you think,’ Donna said, running a hand through her hair.
‘No, I'm sure it's not,’ the conductor said disbelievingly.
‘I can explain,’ Donna assured him.
Ryker said nothing.
‘I fell, I hurt myself,’ she said.
‘This gentleman,’ she nodded towards Ryker, ‘he helped me.
I needed to sit down for a minute.
I must have fainted, I think.
This was the nearest seat.’
She smiled and patted the toilet beneath her.
The conductor looked at Donna, then at Ryker.
‘Is this true?’ he asked the other man.
‘Yes,’ Ryker said sharply, trying to hide his anger.
‘Then why was the door locked?’ the uniformed man wanted to know.
‘I didn't want anyone bursting in and getting the wrong idea, like you have,’ Donna said, smiling again.
‘Well,’ said the conductor, ‘it does look a bit suspicious, you'll admit.
Two people in one lavatory, I mean…’
He allowed the sentence to tail off.
‘I agree,’ Donna echoed.
‘If I could just go back to my seat I'll be okay.
Could you help me, please?’ she asked the conductor.
Ryker regarded her furiously as the uniformed man extended a hand to help her up.
‘Are you two people not together, then?’ the conductor asked.
‘No,’ Donna told him, smiling.
‘It was just lucky for me this gentleman was passing.’
She looked at Ryker.
‘I hurt my ankle when I fell.
The floor was harder than I thought.’
She looked down at her scratched and grazed legs.
‘Would you like me to see if there's a doctor on the train?’ the conductor asked as he walked back through First Class with her.
‘I can get them to call it out over the loudspeaker.’
‘No thanks, I'll be fine.’
Ryker trailed along behind, his expression one of growing agitation.
His chance, it seemed, was gone.
How the hell was he going to get the information he required from her with the conductor prattling about?
He clenched his fists in frustration and annoyance.
And fear?
What would Farrell do if he failed?
The conductor saw Donna to her seat and ensured she was comfortable.
Ryker sat down opposite her, his eyes still blazing.
‘Would you like a brandy?’ the conductor said.
‘It'll calm your nerves.
I can get you one from the buffet car.’
He winked.
‘On the house.’
‘That's very kind of you,’ Donna told him.
‘Thank you.’
He scuttled off to fetch it, leaving them to face one another across the table.
‘I'm going to kill you,’ Ryker hissed.
‘You're not going to do anything,’ Donna told him, anger in her voice.
‘You said you needed me alive, that you wanted some answers.
Well, so do I. I want to know who you are and who you're working for, and don't fuck me around or I'll have this train stopped.
Tell the truth or the law will be here before you can make a move.
I'll tell them you pushed that other bastard out of the train and tried to kill me.’
She looked at him with a challenging stare.
‘Who's Farrell?
You said Farrell didn't want me harmed.
Who is he?
The man who sent you?’
‘Fuck you,’ Ryker said.
She leaned closer.
‘No, fuck you.
You're scared of him, aren't you, whoever he is?
That's why you didn't want that other moron to hurt me.
It's why you pulled me back inside the train when you could have left me to die.
You're not going to get another chance to threaten me.
This train doesn't stop until it reaches London now, and I'm not moving from this seat.
If you want to risk killing me, that's fine, but you're going to have to kill the conductor and the other passengers in this carriage, too.
Have you got the stomach for that, or are you only brave when you're threatening a woman?’
She sat back, smiling.
‘You blew it.
You should have let me fall, like your friend.
But you daren't, dare you?
You gutless piece of shit.’
Ryker leaned forward menacingly, anger colouring his face.
‘One brandy,’ the conductor announced, returning with the drink and handing it to Donna.
She thanked him.
‘Will you stay with me for a minute?
This other gentleman is going back to his seat now,’ she said, smiling at Ryker.
‘I can stay,’ he said through clenched teeth.
‘No,’ said Donna, making a great show of concern for him.
‘I'll be fine now.
Besides, I just need to relax.
I might even get a couple of hours sleep before we reach London.
Thank you for your help.’
Ryker hesitated a moment, then got to his feet.
He paused, looked at her then stalked off down the aisle.
Donna took a sip of the brandy, feeling it burn its way to her stomach.
Most of the chill had left her now and, with Ryker's departure, she felt more comfortable.
Nevertheless, she realized that she was only safe until the train reached King's Cross.
Once in the capital, she was fair game once more.
She had to find a way to escape him.
‘Are there phones on board this train?’ she asked.
‘I'm afraid not,’ the conductor said.
Donna felt her heart sink.
‘I've got one of these bloody things, though, if you want to borrow it,’ the uniformed man said, pulling a portable phone from his pocket.
‘We use them for getting track information and arrival times, that sort of thing.
I can speak to  the driver on it if I want to,’ he said, smiling.
‘Not that I want to, miserable bugger.’
Donna felt her spirits rising again.
‘The reception's a bit haywire sometimes, especially in tunnels, but it should be okay,’ he reassured her.
‘Thank you,’ she said, taking the phone from him.
He checked that she was all right, then told her he'd be back in a while and wandered off down the aisle.
Donna called to him.
‘What time do we get to King's Cross?’
He checked his watch, then pulled a timetable from his jacket pocket.
He ran his finger down the list of times.
‘We've made up some time,’ he informed her.
‘As long as there's no hold-ups, we should be in about 1.30 a.m.’
She thanked him, then turned her attention to the phone, punching in digits.
She glanced at her watch.
10.16 p.m.
At the other end, the phone was picked up.
‘Julie, it's me.’
‘Where the hell are you?
I…’
The line crackled.
‘Just listen to me, I haven't got time to explain.
I'm on a train from Edinburgh, it arrives at King's Cross at 1.30.
Julie, you must be there to pick me up.
Do you understand?
You must be.’
‘Donna, what's going on…?’
‘I told you, I can't explain now.
I'll tell you  everything when I see you.
Julie, we've got to go to the cottage in Sussex.
I want you to drive me from King's Cross down to the cottage, right?
Just listen to me.
Go into the wardrobe in our room, get the guns and the ammunition and bring them with you.
Bring the letter from Chris's solicitor, too.
Please, just promise me you'll do it.’
‘Why can't you tell me…’
Donna cut her short angrily.
‘Just do it, Julie.
King's Cross at 1.30.
For Christ's sake, be there.’
‘I'll be there,’ Julie told her.
Donna pressed the ‘End’ button on the phone and laid it on the table.
While she was on the train she was safe.
Once they reached King's Cross she had no idea what Ryker would do.
She looked at her watch again.
In less than three hours she'd know.
Fifty-Nine
Donna cupped one hand over her eyes and saw the lights of King's Cross through the window as the train slowed to a crawl, preparatory to gliding to a halt.
She was already on her feet, glancing back in the direction of the next carriage where Ryker was.
There were a couple of men standing there by the door, waiting for the train to pull in and stop.
Of Ryker there was no sign.
She picked up her suitcase and made her way along the aisle, pausing to inspect the damage to her legs.
She'd removed her ripped stockings earlier and now, as she looked down at the patchwork of scratches and grazes, she was relieved that there hadn't been more damage.
There was one cut just above the ankle; it had bled only slightly.
She shuddered when she thought what her fate might have been.
The conductor appeared, smiling broadly.
‘Would you like a hand with that case?’ he said.
She accepted the offer gratefully, feeling the train slow down even more as it cruised into the vast amphitheatre of concrete and glass that was the terminus itself.
Other trains, some also newly arrived, stood emptily by platforms, their passengers long since departed.
At this early hour there weren't that many people on the concourse.
It wouldn't be so easy to melt into the background.
She glanced behind her to see if she could catch a glimpse of Ryker.
Still he was nowhere to be seen.
She looked at her watch; they were on time.
She prayed that Julie was waiting for her.
The conductor was babbling on good-naturedly about long train journeys but Donna scarcely heard what he said.
She smiled and nodded as he wittered on, moving towards the door as the train drew into the platform.
The conductor pushed the  door open and peered up the train to see that others were doing the same.
It finally bumped to a halt.
All the doors were thrown open and the uniformed man climbed down first, offering Donna his hand as she stepped onto the platform.
The first thing that struck her was the cold.
It was freezing inside the huge building; it was as if someone had sucked every ounce of warm air from the interior and replaced it with icy breath.
As she exhaled, her own breath clouded before her.
It was quiet, too, every sound echoing around the cavernous dome.
Footsteps on the dark concrete platforms seemed to reverberate inside her head.
She walked quickly beside the conductor, who carried her case towards the barrier.
There was no guard there to check tickets.
Donna glanced around, looking for Ryker amongst the three or four dozen other people who had left the train along with her.
He was nowhere to be seen.
They were drawing closer to the barrier now and Donna began looking for Julie, praying that her sister was waiting, hardly daring to contemplate what she would do if she wasn't.
The conductor was still chatting happily.
Donna didn't even bother to acknowledge his ramblings now, her mind was too occupied.
Her eyes were too busy picking out faces amongst the other passengers.
Where was Ryker?
She glanced over her shoulder.
He was less than ten yards behind her, hands dug deep into his jacket pockets, walking fast, gaining on her.
He pushed past an old woman in his haste to reach Donna, looking at the woman angrily as he nearly tripped over her suitcase.
Donna tried to quicken her pace, hoping the conductor would do likewise.
Ahead of her were half a dozen people, two of them pushing trolleys laden with luggage.
Donna looked back at Ryker, then ahead once more.
She quickly slipped ahead of the trolley pushers as one of them blocked the exit, manoeuvring his way through.
Those behind were prevented from going any further.
Including the conductor.
He walked to the barrier and handed Donna her case over the rail.
‘I'll be okay from here,’ she told him, seeing Ryker drawing nearer.
‘Thank you for your help.’
She took the case and spun round.
The first trolley was still stuck, its owner now flustered, aware that he was blocking everyone else's way.
Ryker pushed against the back of a man trying to get through and got an angry glare for his pains.
He could see Donna on the other side of the barrier heading towards a dark-haired woman, whom she embraced.
They headed for the car park outside.
Ryker vaulted the barrier and ran after them, slipping one hand into his jacket, touching the hilt of the knife.
He ran out through the main doors and looked to his right and left.
No sign of them.
He scurried over to the taxi rank.
None of the vehicles had just picked up.
There was no sign of Donna or the other woman.
He stood on the pavement, hands on his hips.
‘Fuck,’ he rasped, knowing he'd lost them.
He turned and walked slowly back into the station, heading for the payphones.
He found one that took money rather than a card and dialled a number.
His hands were shaking.
It was picked up after a couple of rings.
‘Farrell,’ the voice at the other end said.
‘It's Ryker,’ he said, trying to control the anxiety in his voice.
‘Well?’
‘We lost her.’
At the other end the phone was slammed down.
Sixty
The headlights of the Fiesta cut through the darkness.
It was almost 2.45 a.m.
The roads were all but deserted south of London.
The deeper into Kent Julie drove the more the two women began to feel as if they were the only people left on earth.
Nothing was moving on the roads apart from them, it seemed.
Perhaps it was a good thing.
It was all Julie could do to concentrate on driving, as she listened incredulously to the chain of events her sister recounted.
Donna felt exhausted, drained both physically and emotionally.
She lay slumped in the passenger seat, a jacket around her knees to keep her warm.
The heating was on inside the car but it did little to drive out the chill that seemed to have settled in her bones.
Recalling what had happened to her, especially on the train, served to intensify that cold.
She had come so close to death.
She shuddered.
Was that how Chris had felt seconds before he died?
She closed her eyes for a moment.
‘We should call the police,’ said Julie.
Donna ignored her.
She was thinking of what had happened on the train.
About the two men, their threats.
Their fear of the man who had sent them to find her.
What had Ryker said his name was?
‘Donna, I said we should call the police.
This is too serious now,’ Julie persisted.
Farrell.
She opened her eyes, her tired mind gradually focusing on that name.
On that face.
‘My God,’ she whispered.
‘It was the man at the house the day Chris was buried.’
‘What are you talking about?’
‘I told you that one of the men on the train kept saying that Farrell needed information from me, that Farrell had said I wasn't to be killed.
That day at the house, the day of the funeral, I caught a man in Chris's office going through his papers.
His name was Farrell.
Peter Farrell.’
‘It could be a coincidence.’
‘It could, but I doubt it.
He was looking for something that day; he said it was a book.
Those men were looking for information about a book.
Farrell sent them.
It's the same man, I'm sure of it.’
‘Even if it is, what does it prove?’
‘It proves that Chris had something Farrell wanted.
Something he thinks I've now got.
Something which he was prepared to kill for.’
‘Then call the police,’ Julie insisted.
‘They haven't been able to protect me so far,’ Donna snapped.
‘So what are you going to do with the guns?
Shoot anyone who attacks you?’
‘Did you bring them all?’
‘Yes, and the ammunition.
They're in the boot.
You didn't answer my question.’
She looked across at her sister.
‘Donna, you can't take the law into your own hands.
This isn't America.
It's not some bloody film where the heroine straps on a gun and blows away the bad guys.
This is reality.’
‘And it was reality on that train when I was nearly killed,’ Donna answered angrily.
‘Who do you think you are?
A female Charles Bronson?
Call the police, for Christ's sake.’
‘Julie, whoever those men are, whoever this Farrell is, they want something badly enough to kill for it.
They might have killed Chris.
They've tried to kill me.
If they try again, they might not be too fussy about who they hurt in the process.’
She looked at her sister.
‘You're in danger, too.
Perhaps it would be best if you left me at the cottage and went back to London.
I've already involved you more than I should have.
You should get out while you still can.’
‘You really think I'd leave you now?’ said Julie softly.
‘I wouldn't blame you if you did.’
‘I'm staying with you, Donna.
No matter what.
But I'll tell you something, I'm scared and I don't mind admitting it.’
‘Join the club,’ Donna said flatly.
They drove most of the remainder of the journey in silence, speeding through Kent into West Sussex, along roads flanked by hedges and trees, past isolated houses and farms.
It was approaching 3.15 when the headlamps picked out a sign that proclaimed:
WARDSBY 15 MILES
CHICHESTER 18 MILES
Donna instructed Julie to take the left-hand fork in the road.
Sixty-One
The ferocity of the assault lifted Peter Farrell off his feet.
He was slammed into the wall with crushing force and enough power to knock the wind from him.
Reeling from the onslaught, he toppled forward but managed to keep his feet until a second attack pinned him to the wall and held him there.
‘You said you would get the book,’ snarled Francis Dashwood, gripping Farrell by the collar.
‘We relied on you and you failed.’
Farrell recoiled, not from the verbal tirade but from the rank stench that wafted over him every time Dashwood spoke.
It was a smell like rotting meat, a rancid, cloying odour that made him nauseous.
‘I'm sorry,’ he said breathlessly, trying to inhale as little of the fetid air as possible.
‘Your apologies are no good to us,’ roared Richard Parsons.
‘We need the book, not your pathetic excuses.’
Dashwood let out a howl of frustration and hurled Farrell across the room.
He crashed into a table, somersaulted over it and landed heavily on the carpet.
He lay there for a moment before rolling over and getting to his knees.
The other two men advanced upon him.
‘It has kept us alive for over two hundred years,’ Dashwood told him.
‘Get it.’
Farrell clambered to his feet, breathing heavily, forced to inhale the reeking smell.
He looked at the other two men.
There was a yellow tinge to their skin.
Parsons' eyes looked sunken, with blue-black rings around them making him look badly bruised.
The flesh of his hands appeared loose, as if it didn't fit his bones.
The skin beneath his chin hung in thick folds that swayed back and forth as he walked.
Dashwood looked even worse.
A sticky, pus-like fluid dribbled from the corners of both his eyes.
The orbs themselves were bulging in sunken sockets, criss-crossed by hundreds of tiny red veins, each one of which looked on the point of bursting.
Like Parsons, his skin was sagging in places like an ill-fitting suit.
In others it had begun to peel away in long coils.
One of these coils hung from his left cheek like a spiral, frozen tear.
The stench inside the room was practically intolerable.
‘Your men failed at the house and then on the train,’ Dashwood reminded him.
‘We will not tolerate another failure.
You must get the book and bring it to us personally,’ Parsons told him.
‘Do you have any idea how important it is?
Not just to us, but to everyone connected with this organisation?’
‘If the contents were to be known, as Ward wanted them to be known, the results would  be catastrophic,’ Dashwood reminded him.
‘Get the book.’
He shoved Farrell, who fell backwards, colliding with a chair and almost falling again.
‘It isn't at the house,’ he said, looking at each of the men in turn.
‘We've already checked.
She didn't have it with her…’
Dashwood cut him short.
‘Are you sure of that?’ he snapped.
‘I'm not sure, but…’
Farrell was interrupted by a powerful blow across the face.
As it landed he felt the repulsively soft feel of Dashwood's skin against his own.
‘You know what will happen to us if the book is not found,’ snarled Dashwood.
‘You can see what is already happening.’
He grabbed Farrell again and pushed his face within inches.
‘Look.’
He touched the coil of rotting flesh with his free hand, pulling it slowly free.
The skin tore slightly, leaving a red mark.
Dashwood pushed it towards Farrell's lips, jamming the length of putrid flesh into the other man's mouth.
Farrell closed his eyes as he tasted the rotting matter on his tongue.
‘Taste our pain,’ hissed Dashwood, gripping Farrell's chin, forcing him to chew on the strand of flesh.
As he spoke his foul breath swept over Farrell in a noxious cloud.
‘Smell our suffering.’
Farrell knew he was going to be sick.
He felt Dashwood's index finger inside his  mouth, pushing the slippery piece of skin further into the moist orifice.
‘Swallow it,’ Dashwood demanded.
Farrell did as he was told and retched violently, falling away from Dashwood, feeling his stomach churn, eager to be rid of the disgusting matter inside it.
He bent double and vomited, falling to his knees in the puddle of his own regurgitated stomach contents.
The bitter stench mingled with the odour of putrescent flesh and he almost retched again but found that there was nothing left to bring up.
His muscles contracted but could force nothing else out.
He sucked in deep, racking breaths and looked up at the two men.
Could the word be accurately applied to these two apparitions?
‘Where is the woman now?’
Parsons wanted to know.
‘She hasn't been back to her house,’ Farrell said.
‘Someone picked her up at King's Cross.
Another woman.’
He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
‘They could be anywhere.’
Dashwood took a menacing step towards him.
‘My guess is they've gone to the other house,’ he said quickly.
‘The one Connelly mentioned before he died.
If they have, we'll find them.
And the book.’
‘If you don't, it will mean your death as well as ours,’ Dashwood told him.
‘Now go.’
The stench of death hung in the air like an odorous, invisible cloud.

The cottage stood about two hundred yards back from the road, accessible only by a narrow drive flanked on both sides by stone walls.
The walls extended round not only the front garden but the entire property, stark grey against the white walls of the cottage.
The slate roof was mildewed in places and the guttering shaky, but otherwise the place was in a good state of repair.
Ward had bought it four years earlier with part of the advance on one of his books.
He and Donna used it during the summer, making frequent weekend trips; Ward himself had written at least two books there.
The cottage had no phone, something he had insisted on to prevent interruption when he was working.
The nearest neighbour, a farmer well into his seventies, was more than five miles and a range of low hills away.
Donna guessed that it was more than two months since she had been to the cottage.
She wondered if he had ever brought Suzanne Regan here and found it more than usually difficult to wipe the thought from her mind.
Even the stress of the past few hours had not removed the memories of his betrayal.
She stood in the small sitting-room and ran her finger along the top of a sideboard, drawing a  line in the dust that had accumulated.
The room was about twelve feet square, furnished with old, antique oak merchandise they'd bought from a shop in Chichester during their first visit to the place.
It had few ornaments: a vase or two, an ashtray and a couple of ceramic figures.
The windows were leaded.
The ground floor consisted of just the sitting-room and a large kitchen.
The entrance hall seemed disproportionately large.
There was a trap-door in the centre of the kitchen floor, which led down to a deep cellar.
Ward kept old manuscripts down there.
He also kept a substantial store of wine in the subterranean room.
He had never been a great wine drinker, but on every visit to the Mayfair Hotel in London (which he used often) he was presented with a complimentary bottle of wine.
He never drank them but always brought them home with him to add to the array in the cellar.
The floor of the lower ground room was of earth.
Donna rarely ventured down the wooden ladder into it; it was not well lit and, despite Ward–s attempts to convince her otherwise, she was certain that the entire cellar was seething with spiders, creatures she was frightened of.
A bare wood staircase led up to the first floor, which comprised a bathroom and two bedrooms.
In the first bedroom a door opened onto a short flight of rickety steps that led to an attic.
Ward had often threatened to have it converted into a work room but, as is the case with most attics, it  remained nothing more than a storehouse for junk that wasn't wanted elsewhere in the cottage.
The obvious thing seemed to be to retire to bed; both women felt crushing exhaustion.
But they seemed to have reached that point where they could not sleep despite their tiredness.
Donna took a hurried bath, Julie made them some tea and, as the hands on the clock above the open fireplace crawled round to 3.56, they both sat down, one on either side of the table in the centre of the room.
In the centre of the table were two aluminium boxes resembling metal attache cases.
Donna flipped the first one open and lifted the lid.
In the half-light cast by the lamps the metal of the Smith and Wesson .38 and the Beretta 92s gleamed.
Donna took each weapon from the case in turn, checked it and replaced it.
She then opened the second case and performed a similar ritual with the .357 and the Charter Arms .22.
She flipped the cylinders from the revolvers and checked the firing actions, listening to the metallic click of the hammers on empty chambers.
She worked the slide of the Beretta, then took fifteen rounds from the box of 9mm ammunition.
She thumbed them into the magazine before placing it carefully back in the box with the weapon.
She loaded the revolvers, too, leaving the chamber beneath the hammer empty.
Those two she replaced, then carried upstairs.
‘I hope to God you know what you're doing,’ said Julie when her sister returned.
‘This is life and death, Julie,’ she said solemnly.
‘Then why don't you just call the police?’ the younger woman said, agitated.
Donna didn't answer; she merely sipped her tea.
‘I think you want it to come to this, don't you?’
Julie snapped.
‘You don't care if you kill them.’
‘They tried to kill me.’
‘And if you do kill anyone, you'll be the one who'll go to prison.’
‘I'll take that chance.’
‘Let's just hope it doesn't go that far.’
‘It already has.’
They regarded each other for long moments, then Julie reached into her handbag for the envelope.
She handed it to Donna, who turned it over in her hands, seeing Ward's handwriting on the front.
She smiled thinly and ran her index finger over the Biro scribble.
I miss you
‘It can wait until morning,’ she said quietly.
‘We should get some sleep.’
Julie agreed.
Donna took the envelope upstairs with her and laid it on the bedside table.
Before she got into bed she touched it once, running her fingertips over the smooth manilla package.
Then, naked, she slipped between the sheets.
Her last waking thought was of her dead  husband.
As she drifted off to sleep, a single tear rolled from her eye.
I miss you.

The book is called Domus Vitae, which is translated as ‘The House of Life’.
It was written by a man called Edward Chardell in 1753.
Only one hundred copies were printed.
The copy I discovered is, as far as I know, the only one in existence.
It is vital to the members of The Sons of Midnight.
Vital to their survival and also to their protection.
Every member of the club, from its formation back in 1721 right up until the present day, is forced to write his name in the book.
I have those names.
I know those names.
That is why I stole the book and that is why they want me dead and why they need the book back.
If its contents were released then they would be destroyed; but also the repercussions would be enormous.
The actual content of the book itself consists of a series of spells and invocations designed to be used at meetings of the club, just as similar books were used at meetings of The Hell Fire Club all over Britain and Ireland.
Each club had one of these books which they called Grimoires, and –he loss or destruction of these Grimoires has  accounted for the disappearance of other branches of The Hell Fire Club over the years.
The Sons of Midnight are the only remaining group I know of, still linked to the original Hell Fire Club.
I have researched everything about them, their customs, their members and their motives.
They trusted me enough to allow me into their ranks, but when I saw what they were planning I knew that the only answer was to destroy them, expose them.
They must be stopped.
Their aims are sedition.
They have infiltrated everywhere.
Every branch of the Media, Politics and the Church.
They are more powerful than anyone can imagine, more dangerous than anyone could realize.
Perhaps I might be able to stop them by exposing them but I don't think they will allow that to happen.
However, I have made contingency plans.
Even if they kin me there are still ways to stop them.
Destroy the book.
Destroy that and you destroy them.
Especially Dashwood and Parsons.
They need the book to live.
Its very existence guarantees them life.
Without it they are dead.
But don't look to anyone for help.
They have members everywhere.
No one can be trusted.
Fight them alone.
I tried and I would have succeeded.
I hid the book from them, I covered my tracks as well as I could.
The location of the book I felt was too important to put down in this note.
The key you win find enclosed fits a safety deposit box in the Chichester Branch of Lloyds Bank.
Take the key and remove the contents of the box then find  the book.
Directions and instructions and also a description of the Grimoire itself are contained in there.
The bank manager, Maurice Langton, is under orders not to allow anyone to open the door except you, Donna.
Take this letter with you when you go there.
I pray that it is you reading this, my darling.
If not then nothing I have written before matters.
If it is you, then do this for me.
I love you.
I will always love you, more than I thought it was possible to love anyone.
Christopher Ward.
Sixty-Four
Donna put down the note and ran her hands over the paper, as if trying to smooth out the creases.
She was shaking slightly.
Julie could see the tears in her eyes as she re-read the sheet of paper, touching her dead husband's name with her fingers as she read.
‘Oh, Chris,’ she murmured quietly, wiping one eye with the back of her hand.
He loved you.
Then why did he have an affair?
Jesus, even now it plagued her.
She lowered her head.
‘Donna, are you all ?’
Julie asked, slipping one arm around her sister's shoulders.
Donna nodded.
‘We have to go,’ she said, sucking in a deep breath, folding the note again.
She looked at the small key on the table, then dropped that into the envelope with the note.
‘No one can be trusted,’ Julie said, echoing the words on the paper.
‘You were right not to call the police.’
‘Is my paranoia catching?’
Donna laughed humourlessly.
‘I've said it to you before, but I'll say it again.
If you want to leave I'll understand, but you're the only one I can trust now.’
Julie touched a hand to her cheek.
‘We'll do it together,’ she said softly, holding Donna's gave.
The older woman stood up and the two of them embraced, holding each other tightly, neither wanting to let go, united in their grief and also in their determination.
‘Come on,’ said Donna finally.
‘Let's get to that bank.’
In the daylight Julie could see the holes in the road which, the previous night, she'd only been able to feel.
The surface was badly pockmarked and the car bumped and bounced over the uneven thoroughfare, its journey only becoming smoother as they reached the main road that would lead them into Chichester itself.
Along the way they passed through one or two collections of houses masquerading as villages.
The sun managed to escape the shackles of dark cloud every now and then; when it did, glorious golden light fell across the countryside.
But for the most part the land remained in shadow.
As they drew close to the outskirts of Chichester itself rain clouds were gathering.
As Julie finally found a parking space close to the bank the first droplets of rain were striking the windscreen of the car, like oversized tears.
The two women hurried across to the main doors of the bank.
It was quiet inside.
At the ‘Enquiries’ desk a young man with a strange, flattened haircut looked up from behind the counter.
He smiled, ran swift appraising eyes over both women and coloured immediately.
‘Can I help you?’ he asked.
‘I want to see the manager, please,’ Donna told him.
‘Can I ask what it concerns?’
‘Could you just fetch him, please?
It is important.
Tell him my name is Donna Ward.
My husband was Christopher Ward.’
The young man nodded and scuttled off, returning a moment later with a much older man in tow.
The older man regarded the two women expressionlessly for a moment, then stepped forward.
Donna made quick introductions.
The man told her in a broad Scots accent that he was Maurice Langton, the manager.
Then he invited them both through into his office.
‘I was very sorry to hear about your husband, Mrs Ward,’ Langton said, closing the door of his office and ushering them towards two chairs.
‘My husband kept a safety deposit box here, didn't he?’
Donna said.
She reached into her handbag and took out the key.
‘I need to see the contents.’
‘There are one or two forms to be signed first…’
Langton began but Donna cut him short.
‘That's all right,’ she said briskly.
‘It's important.’
Langton looked at her for a moment, then reached into his desk.
He produced the necessary documents and handed them to her, pointing out where she should sign.
She did so and handed them back to him, her irritation scarcely hidden.
Langton realized her impatience and ushered them out of the office towards another door, which he opened with a heavy key he took from his pocket.
Beyond it fell a flight of stone steps which led down to the bank's vault.
The walls on either side of the stairwell were dazzling in their brightness.
Led by the bank manager, the two women descended to a corridor and more antiseptically white walls that seemed to crowd in on them like banks of snow.
Langton led them through two more doors, finally coming to a small room with a desk and two chairs.
To the right was another door; beside this one stood a uniformed man in what looked like a Securicor outfit.
He looked impassively at the trio of visitors as they approached.
Julie waited outside while Donna and Langton passed through the last door into the vault itself.
She saw hundreds of drawer facings, row upon  row of safety deposit boxes.
Langton led her to the one she sought.
‘Your key, Mrs Ward,’ he said.
Donna just stared at the box.
‘I need your key,’ he said, almost apologetically.
She nodded, handed it to him and watched as he put her key into one of the locks and the duplicate he carried into the other, turning both simultaneously.
He pulled the drawer free and carried it outside for her, setting it on the desk.
‘Just call me when you've finished,’ he said and stepped back.
Donna sat looking at the box for long moments.
Then, finally, hands quivering slightly, she reached for the contents.
All it contained were two envelopes.
Two flat, white envelopes.
‘What the hell is this?’ said Julie.
‘This is the big secret?’
Donna slipped the envelopes into her bag and called Langton back over.
‘Did you know what was inside the box?’ she asked him.
The manager looked aggrieved at the suggestion he might be privy to the contents of one of the high-security lockers.
‘You knew there were just two envelopes in there?’ she continued.
‘I had no idea what was in there,’ he said.
‘Was my husband alone when he brought them  in?’
Donna wanted to know.
Or did he have another woman with him?
‘Most certainly,’ Langton told her.
‘Is there something wrong, Mrs Ward?’
She shook her head, thanked him for his co-operation and then headed for the way out.
Julie followed closely behind.
They passed back the way they had come, past the gleaming white walls and up the stairs.
Donna thanked Langton again and the two women left the bank.
Inside the car, Donna glanced at the two envelopes then slipped them into her handbag.
‘Get us home,’ she said, ‘as quick as you can.’
Sixty-Five
By the time Julie parked the Fiesta outside the cottage the sky was a mass of dark cloud.
Rain was falling fast now, drenching the countryside, turning the road that led to the cottage to mud, puddling in the ruts.
The two women jumped out and sprinted for the front door of the cottage, Donna struggling with the key.
She finally pushed the door open and they both tumbled gratefully inside.
Donna hurried through into the kitchen and sat down at the wooden table, pulling the envelopes from her handbag.
For long moments she stared at them, as if reluctant to open them.
She knew for sure that  one contained the means to finding the Grimoire.
The contents of the other was a mystery.
‘Open them, Donna,’ said Julie, her impatience getting the better of her.
Donna looked at her sister reproachfully.
‘Give me time,’ she said quietly.
A part of her didn't want to; in some strange way it meant severing her links with Chris.
As long as there had been secrets, she had felt close to him but now, with the opening of these two slim packages, the last of those secrets would be gone.
Just like he was gone.
Her hands were shaking as she reached for the first of the envelopes.
It looked relatively new.
The paper was untainted by age.
She wondered how long they had lain in the safety deposit box.
There was a single sheet of paper in the first one.
It bore a name and an address.
‘George Paxton,’ she read aloud.
‘Wax Museum.’
And then an address in Portsmouth.
‘That must be where he hid the book,’ said Donna.
‘He wrote a novel about a waxworks a few years ago.
Chris said he'd become friendly with the owner; that must be who this Paxton character is.’
‘Why hide it there?’
Julie wondered.
Donna could only shrug.
‘We don't even know what the bloody thing looks like,’ Julie added.
‘It could be anywhere there.
Paxton might even have it himself.
How the hell are we going to find it?’
There was more writing at the bottom of the sheet.
‘The Crest on the Grimoire is a hawk, family crest of its author,’ she read.
She looked at Julie, her eyes alight.
‘A hawk?’
Donna reached into her handbag and pulled out the photo of Ward and the five other men.
She looked carefully at the picture, studying the rings on the index fingers of the two shadowy figures.
They too bore engravings of some kind.
She squinted more closely.
‘A hawk,’ she said triumphantly, jabbing the picture with her index finger.
‘The crest on those rings shows a hawk.
You can see the wings.’
Julie squinted at them.
‘Jesus,’ she murmured.
Donna was already opening the second envelope.
It was another single sheet of paper, this time with typed letters on it:
RATHFARNHAM, DUBLIN.
BRASENOSE COLLEGE, OXFORD.
REGENCY PLACE, EDINBURGH.
CONDUIT STREET, LONDON.
Dublin, Oxford, Edinburgh and London.
And beside each entry D.
‘Chris was at all these places shortly before he died,’ Donna said.
‘They must have been meeting places for The Hell Fire Club he discovered.’
D for Dashwood?
‘We have to get to Portsmouth,’ Donna said, ‘and find that book.’
‘We can't go in this weather,’ Julie said, looking out of the window.
The rain was coming down in a solid curtain.
It was as if God had kicked a bucket of water over.
‘We'll be stranded, with the state of the roads around here.’
‘As soon as it stops,’ Donna said.
‘If it stops,’ Julie added quietly, gazing up into the heavens.
The rain continued to pour down.
7.08 p.m.
The sky still wept.
The ceaseless deluge had turned the small front yard of the cottage into a swamp.
Water poured through the guttering and splashed noisily from the eaves.
It was falling so fast that rivulets of rain streaming down the window-panes made it difficult to see out at all.
Darkness had come prematurely with the deluge, the gloom summoned early by such an abundance of black cloud.
The sky looked like one massive mottled rain cloud.
Donna sat in the sitting-room, glancing endlessly at the sheets of paper they'd picked up from the bank that day and also at the notes Ward had left.
She knew the words off almost by heart.
‘Destroy the book and you destroy them.’
She exhaled deeply and massaged the back of her neck with one hand.
‘They must be stopped.’
A throbbing headache was beginning to gnaw at her.
‘They have infiltrated everywhere.’
Donna closed her eyes for a moment.
‘No one can be trusted.’
‘Donna.’
Julie's shout caused her eyes to snap open.
She looked round and saw her sister standing at the window, gazing out.
‘Come here,’ the younger woman said, a note of urgency in her voice.
Donna did as she was asked and stood beside her sister, peering through the rain and darkness.
Two cars were moving towards the house, both with their lights turned off.
‘Who are they?’
Julie wanted to know.
Donna was reasonably sure she knew.
When she spoke, her voice was low.
‘Lock the doors and windows,’ she said.
‘Hurry.’
Sixty-six
The cars stopped about twenty yards from the front of the cottage.
One of them parked across the narrow track leading away from the building; it acted as a barrier.
Donna saw men scuttle from the vehicles, two of them running towards the house, slipping in the mud but keeping their balance.
She recognized one of them as Peter Farrell.
Julie was busily locking the doors and windows, sliding bolts and turning keys.
Donna seemed transfixed by the approaching men.
She saw two more of them move towards the sides of the cottage.
She turned and ran upstairs.
‘What's happening?’
Julie asked breathlessly, hurrying to secure a window-lock on one of the kitchen windows.
The face loomed up out of the darkness and leered at her through the rain-soaked glass.
Julie screamed and took a step back.
The man held something in his hands.
Something he was swinging towards the window.
The iron bar struck the frame and the glass simultaneously, shattering the glass, sending shards spraying into the kitchen.
Julie screamed again and threw herself to one side, hissing in pain as a silver of broken glass sliced through the flesh on the back of her left hand.
The man outside struck at the window again, smashing more of the wooden frame, then he dropped the iron bar and snaked one hand inside, trying to slip the catch.
‘No,’ shouted Julie.
She picked up a knife lying on the draining board by the sink, and drove it towards the man's hand.
She heard him shriek in agony as the blade pierced it, cutting through the web of skin between his thumb and index finger.
Embedded in the wood, it momentarily  skewered him to the window-frame.
Julie saw blood pumping thickly from the wound.
With a shout of pain he tore his hand free, the flesh ripping as he dragged himself away from the knife, leaving it embedded in the wood.
Julie snatched at the knife as the man disappeared back into the blackness outside.
Rain now poured in through the broken window, the wind also whipping through,buffeting Julie as she moved across to the back door.
The impact against it was enormous.
It seemed to bow in the centre; for one terrible second she thought that it was going to split.
The second blow sent the door flying open.
For fleeting seconds Julie found herself staring into the rain-soaked face of the intruder.
He fixed her in a maddened stare and she saw the blood running from his gashed hand.
‘Fucking bitch,’ he hissed and lunged towards her.
On the cooker to her right stood a frying pan the two women had used for their meal less than an hour ago.
Julie snatched up the heavy skillet and swung it with all her strength.
It smacked savagely into the man's face, flattening his nose.
The bones splintered under the force of the blow and blood spilled down his chin and the front of his jacket.
He staggered.
She struck again, wielding the frying pan like a club, bringing it down hard on the top of his head with a blow hard enough to cut his scalp.
He dropped to his knees and tried to scramble away but Julie hit him again, kicking him hard in the ribs as he fell to the ground.
She dropped the frying pan and used both hands to push the back door shut, heaving with all her strength as the man tried to block it with his body.
She pulled the door back a foot or so then slammed it forward, catching him between the heavy wooden door and the frame.
He grunted in pain.
She slammed it on him again.
And again.
He let go and ducked back into the driving rain.
Julie banged the door shut and slid the bolts into place.
Donna had been rummaging beneath the bed upstairs, where she'd pulled out both of the metal cases.
She flipped one open and took out the Beretta and the .38, jamming one into the waistband of her jeans.
Then she rushed back towards the stairs, almost falling in her haste to get back to the ground floor.
As she dashed into the sitting-room she heard movement outside the front door and immediately swung the automatic up into firing position.
It had been a while since she'd fired a pistol and the initial retort took even her by surprise.
In the confines of the cottage the noise was thunderous.
The 9mm bullet left the barrel travelling at over  1,200 feet a second and cut a hole through the door.
She fired again, and again.
Movement by the window.
Donna fired.
The glass exploded outwards and rain suddenly came pouring in through the hole.
The curtains billowed madly as the wind caught them and Donna dashed across to the light switch and slapped it hard, plunging the room into darkness.
With her ears ringing from the massive blast of the weapon she threw herself down and crawled across to the wall by the front door, able to see back through the sitting-room to the kitchen.
She could see Julie also crouching down, one hand closed around the handle of the frying pan.
Outside she heard footsteps in the sucking mud.
The lights upstairs were still on; if she could only get to a window she might be able to see what the men outside were doing.
Rain continued to sweep into the cottage, driven by the strong wind that screamed around the building.
For interminable seconds the only sounds were the wind and rain and the heavy beating of her own heart.
Donna crouched where she was, the Beretta held close to her, the stink of cordite strong in her nostrils.
The attackers had obviously been surprised by the ferocity of their defence.
Perhaps, she  reasoned, they had left, not expecting to be greeted with guns.
There was no sound from outside, although it was difficult to pick out anything in the torrential rain that battered both cottage and landscape.
Donna got to her feet, still keeping low, and moved towards the small round window close to the front door in the hall.
If only she could get a look, see what they were up to…
It was pitch black; she could scarcely see a hand in front of her.
Her breathing was deep and she tried to control it, tried to stop herself hyperventilating.
She gripped the pistol more tightly as she reached the wall beneath the window and rose slowly.
Just one quick look.
Her heart thudded madly against her ribs and the blood sang in her ears.
She steadied herself, ready to look through the window.
Then the first burst of gunfire tore across the front of the cottage.
Sixty-seven
The roar of the UZI sub-machine gun was deafening.
In the howling wind and driving rain the burst of 9mm fire looked and sounded like  man-made thunder and lightning.
The muzzle flash illuminated Farrell and the yard around him for several feet as he raked the sub-gun back and forth, spent cartridge cases spewing from the weapon; smoke and steam rising into the damp air.
Windows were blasted inwards by the fusillade.
Bullets drilled into wood or stone or sang off the walls with a loud whine.
Lumps of plaster were torn free.
Part of the guttering at the front of the cottage was blown away.
The hammer finally slammed down on an empty chamber.
Farrell angrily ripped the empty magazine free and rammed a fresh one in.
A dark figure appeared at his side, limping.
‘She locked the back,’ said Frank Stark, wiping blood from his broken nose away with the back of his hand.
‘I didn't expect her to have a gun,’ said Brian Kellerman, peering at the cottage, shielding his eyes from the driving rain.
‘I don't care if she's got a fucking cannon in there,’ Farrell snapped, pulling back the slide on the UZI.
‘Get inside.’
He fired another short burst from the sub-gun, blowing in an upstairs window.
Fragments of glass and shattered window-frame fell.
He raised his eyebrows.
The porch was directly beneath the window.
Anyone managing to get on top of the porch could easily clamber up through that bedroom window.
Farrell grabbed Kellerman and pointed at the window.
‘You and Stark get in through there,’ he said.
‘Ryker, you go round the back again.
Listen, all of you, we need Ward's wife alive, got it?’
‘What about the other woman?’
Stark wanted to know.
‘Who gives a fuck?’ said Farrell and opened fire.
More bullets spattered the front of the cottage, drilling lines back and forth in the stonework.
Dust was washed away as the rain continued to pelt down.
Stark and Kellerman ran towards the house, keeping low, as anxious about Farrell's erratic covering fire as they were about Donna's possible retaliation.
Three bullets suddenly hit the ground only inches ahead of Stark.
The muzzle flash that accompanied their arrival came from inside the house.
He pitched forward, throwing himself down in the glutinous mud, covering his head with his hands as Farrell replied, bullets slicing through the air and singing above the prone man's body, missing him, it seemed, by mere inches.
He kept his face pressed to the muck as bullets drilled holes in the wall and door.
Lumps of wood were blasted free.
More shots from the Beretta came back, one of them striking the car.
The 9mm slug exploded one of the Orion's headlights, smashing the housing  and causing Farrell to jump back and seek cover behind the vehicle.
Kellerman reached the porch and hauled himself up onto it, hoping that the wooden canopy would take his weight.
He looked down and saw his colleague still lying in the mud, not daring to move.
Kellerman wondered if he'd been hit.
He turned and saw that the window ledge was about three feet above him.
He steadied himself, then shot out both hands and gripped it, hauling himself up the wall to the beckoning entrance.
Farrell saw him and smiled.
Donna scrambled through the hall to the sitting-room, the automatic smoking in her hands.
‘How many of them are there?’
Julie asked frantically.
‘It's hard to tell,’ Donna said breathlessly.
‘I think I might have hit one of them.’
She crept towards the shattered front window and peered out.
Stark was no longer lying in the mud.
‘Shit,’ snapped Donna, sinking back down to the floor.
Rain was still driving through the broken window.
‘Oh God,’ gasped Julie, pointing towards the kitchen.
Donna saw it too and her eyes widened in panic.
One of the men had set fire to the kitchen curtains.
Flames were licking hungrily at the material; it was blazing fiercely.
She could smell petrol.
‘Put it out,’ she screamed at Julie as another burst of fire from the UZI spattered the cottage.
Donna sucked in a deep breath and headed for the stairs, intent on getting a clearer look at what was going on outside.
From a vantage point up high she would be able to see their attackers.
Julie meanwhile was filling a saucepan with water, trying to stay clear of the flaring curtains.
Thick black smoke spread through the room, thousands of tiny cinders filling the air like black snow.
She coughed as she felt the heat searing the air in her lungs.
It made her eyes water but she stayed where she was until the saucepan was full, then tried to douse the flames.
One curtain went out, extinguished by the shower of water.
Julie tugged hard at the remains of it and pulled it down.
The other one continued to burn.
She refilled the saucepan, sweat soaking her body despite the cold wind and driving rain blasting through the smashed window.
Ryker loomed at her through the flames and she hurled the water both at him and at the fire.
He grinned.
She dropped the saucepan as she saw him raise the pistol and aim at her.
He fired twice and Julie threw herself down as bullets ploughed into the kitchen table.
Another hit a vase on the sideboard.
It promptly disintegrated in a cloud of dust, pieces spinning in all directions.
He fired again.
Julie rolled over, finally propping herself against the back door, touching the bolts there to reassure herself that it was locked.
She almost screamed when she felt the blows raining against it.
Donna emerged on the landing, momentarily frozen, unsure what to do.
She had heard the shots from downstairs, heard Julie's shouts, but what to do?
Go back downstairs or try and get a better shot at one of the bastards from up here?
She chose to move on.
The door to her left was open slightly; she could feel cold air blowing through.
Donna shoved the door open, steadying herself against the frame, the Beretta raised.
Stark was caught completely by surprise.
For one moment he looked as if he was raising his hands in surrender, then he leapt forward.
Donna got off two shots before he crashed into her.
The first missed and blasted a hole in the far wall.
The second caught Stark in the left shoulder.
The bullet ripped through his deltoid muscle and pulverized part of the scapula as it exited, the impact enough to spin him almost three hundred and sixty degrees.
He yelled in pain, then crashed into Donna, both of them falling, hitting the floor with a thud that knocked the wind from her.
The Beretta flew from her hand, bounced against the wall and skidded down the stairs.
She reached for the .38 jammed into her waistband, trying to pull it free as Stark grabbed for her throat.
Donna didn't manage to get her finger around the trigger but she did pull the weapon clear, closing her hand around it and using it as a club.
She drove it into the side of his head as hard as she could, hearing a crack as she smashed his temporal bone.
Stark fell to one side and Donna scrambled out from beneath him.
He tottered drunkenly to his feet and reached inside his jacket.
She saw his fingers close around the butt of a .45.
Donna fired twice.
From point-blank range the first bullet hit him in the stomach, doubling him up as it punched a hole just to the left of his navel, ploughing through intestines before lodging close to his spine.
The second hit him in the right shoulder, the impact lifting him off his feet and sending him toppling towards the head of the stairs.
He threw out a hand, clutching at empty air, then fell backwards, tumbling head over heels down the steps, finally crashing to a stop at the bottom, where he lay in a spreading pool of blood.
Downstairs, Julie looked across and saw Stark hit the floor, her attention diverted only momentarily from the blows still raining against the door.
She felt sure that, any second, the wood must splinter and the attacker would be inside.
She looked around desperately for something to defend herself with.
The tool box was lying in one corner of the room, close to the cellar hatch.
Jesus, the cellar.
That was it.
She crawled across the floor in the darkness, her body drenched in sweat, her eyes stinging from all the smoke.
She grabbed a hammer from the tool box and crawled back towards the cellar hatch.
Lifting it, she peered down into the blackness below, feeling the first rung of a rickety ladder as she dangled her foot into the yawning gap.
She eased herself down a few rungs, praying it wouldn't collapse under her.
The stench of damp that enveloped her was noxious; she tried to take short breaths.
Gripping the hammer in one fist and propping the hatch up with her free hand, she crouched low so that she had about an inch gap through which she could see the back door.
The door was starting to split from its merciless battering.
One of the hinges was coming loose.
Julie gripped the hatch and waited.
She almost screamed when she felt something soft touch her face.
A spider the size of her thumbnail dropped past her in the gloom, its legs brushing her cheek.
She gripped the hammer and waited.
The door was practically off its hinges now.
One more blow and the attacker would be inside.
Julie swallowed hard, closing her eyes.
There was a final crash and the door, and Ryker, hurtled into the kitchen.
Upstairs, Donna heard the sound of forced entry, her eyes still fixed on the barely moving form of Stark.
Had she turned round quicker, she might have seen Kellerman advancing upon her.
Sixty-Eight
The attacks happened simultaneously.
Kellerman launched himself at Donna.
Ryker crashed into the kitchen, looking for Julie.
Donna heard a grunt as Kellerman grabbed her, pinning her arms by her sides, lifting her off her feet.
She could not raise the pistol to use against him.
She found herself looking directly into his face as his arms tightened around her in a bear hug that threatened to crush her ribs.
With horror she realized he was carrying her to the top of the stairs.
Donna twisted in his grip but could not free herself.
She screamed loudly, but it was a bellow of rage not helplessness.
Kellerman grinned at her but the gesture faded instantly as Donna spat in his face, the mucus sliding down his cheek thickly like gelatinous tears.
She snaked her head forward and bit hard into his nose, biting down with all her strength, ignoring his shrieks of pain, trying not to gag on the blood that filled her mouth.
He let go of her and staggered back, reaching for his gun.
She ran at him now, driving one foot up, kicking him with all her force between the legs.
He groaned and dropped to his knees, grabbing her other leg and pulling hard enough to send her flying.
She hit the floor with a bone-jarring thud and lay there, momentarily dazed.
Kellerman leapt on her, his weight pressing down.
She jabbed two fingers into his eyes and he screamed and rolled off her, trying to rise to his feet, blinded by her attack.
Her stabbing nails had torn his left upper eyelid and blood from the wound dribbled down the side of his face, some of it running across the orb itself, turning one half of his world crimson.
Donna tried to raise the .38, anxious to get a shot at him, but he knocked her hand down and the gun discharged into the floor.
The thunderous retort deafened them both momentarily.
He struck out again, this time with the back of his hand, catching her a blow across the face which split her top lip and sent her reeling.
But she still  held the gun and, as Kellerman turned on her, Donna shook her head clear and fired at him.
Luck playing a somewhat greater part in the matter than judgement, the bullet struck him in the calf, tore through the muscles there and exited, spattering the wall behind with blood and pink tissue.
He screamed and almost lost his footing as he made for the stairs.
Donna, her head spinning, tried to follow but he was halfway to the bottom before she managed to get off another shot.
The heavy-grain slug powered into the wall inches above Kellerman's head.
He looked up at her, teeth gritted, his face a mask of blood from his injuries.
She saw him stop and slide an arm around Stark's waist, carrying his companion towards the front door, both of them leaving a trail of blood behind.
Donna tasted her own blood as it ran into her mouth from the cut on her lip.
She tried to follow and almost fell down the stairs, gritting her teeth to prevent herself passing out.
She had to get to Julie.
As Ryker came careering into the kitchen, Julie threw back the cellar hatch and came hurtling forth like a maddened trap-door spider, brandishing the hammer.
So startled was he by this sudden onslaught, Ryker momentarily froze, rooted to the spot.
Julie swung the hammer with all her strength and caught him in the mouth with its gleaming head.
She heard teeth shatter under the impact, saw one of them driven through his top lip.
Saw blood burst from the cut.
He reeled backwards, one smashed incisor falling from his bleeding, pulped gums.
Julie struck again, this time catching him just above the right eye, tearing the flesh.
The hammer carved through his eyebrow and opened up a cut as deep as the frontal bone it cracked.
Julie spun the weapon, bringing the clawed part down on his hand as he raised his fists in defence.
The metal tore into his flesh, ripping it away, slicing effortlessly through skin and muscles, exposing a portion of the middle-finger knuckle.
Ryker ran for the shattered back door, out into the driving rain and the darkness, which suddenly seemed welcoming.
Julie stood by the back door, rain drenching her, mingling with the tears of rage and fear on her cheeks.
She tasted blood and thought that it was Ryker's, but then realized that her own face was gashed just below the left eye, she guessed by flying glass.
Panting breathlessly, she turned from the door and moved through to the hall, where Donna was trying to make her way down the stairs.
From outside, they both heard the sound of car engines.
Julie, still gripping the bloodied hammer, looked cautiously through the window by the front door.
She saw two cars disappearing down the dirt track, away from the cottage, their tail-lights gradually swallowed by the gloom and the relentless downpour.
‘Donna,’ she gasped.
Donna said nothing; she just dropped to her knees, the .38 still gripped in her fist, face bruised, her lip bleeding.
Julie dropped the hammer and found she was sobbing uncontrollably.
She was standing in a pool of blood.
Sixty-Nine
It wasn't a matter of if they would return; it was merely a question of when.
Donna sat at the sitting-room window, the Beretta on the sill in front of her.
On the coffee table to her right lay the .38 and the .357.
All had been reloaded.
On the sofa behind her Julie was sleeping fitfully, a blanket covering her, her face pale and drawn, dark rings beneath her eyes.
The cuts on her hands and arms had been cleaned and bathed, then covered with plaster.
She'd been fortunate to escape more serious injury from the flying glass.
Donna herself touched her lip tentatively with one finger, feeling how it had swollen.
There was a dark bruise surrounding it; she hoped that the discoloration wouldn't last too long.
Her sides ached when she inhaled, and when she moved too quickly she felt a sharp pain in her lumbar region.
As the night wore on it began to diminish.
There were more bruises on her arms and legs, and some on her shoulders.
The house had been cleaned as well as was possible.
The broken windows had been boarded up with pieces of wood from the attic.
Donna had re-attached the back door to its frame as well, while Julie mopped up the blood in the hallway — although she finally passed out during the task.
Donna had helped her onto the sofa, woken her gently but then realized that she was becoming hysterical.
She had been forced to slap her face to quieten her.
Tears had followed, both women understandably shaken by their ordeal, by the knowledge of how close to death they had come.
And of how close they might come again.
Donna felt herself dozing and sat upright, shaking her head free of the crushing tiredness that threatened to envelope her.
Another fifteen minutes and she would wake Julie.
They had agreed to keep the vigil between them.
One would watch for two hours while the other slept.
Donna reached out to touch the butt of the automatic, as if the feel of the cold steel would somehow shock her from her lethargy.
How easy it would be to surrender now, she thought, not only to sleep but also to the demands of these men.
How easy to give them the book they sought, to be done with the entire affair.
And just walk away?
Donna knew that was impossible.
Even if she did tell them the whereabouts of the Grimoire, there was no way they were going to spare her or Julie.
Too much damage had been done; she knew too much about them now.
They would have to kill her.
As they had done her husband?
She still didn't know for sure if Chris had been murdered.
The police had been convinced it was a genuine accident that took his life (and that of his mistress) but after what she'd been through, after what she had discovered, Donna could not believe that men willing to kill for the possession of a book had not taken the life of the man she'd loved.
Once loved?
Before his affair?
She administered a mental rebuke.
She and her sister had almost been killed only hours earlier and all she could think about, it seemed, was her dead husband's infidelity.
No one can be trusted.
How prophetic had been those words he'd written.
How apt.
How irritatingly, fittingly, fucking appropriate.
She gritted her teeth in anger and pain.
And frustration?
No.
She would not give in to these men.
She would not let them have the Grimoire.
She wanted it.
Not because she needed it, but because she was determined no one else should have it.
It was like a prize.
This hunt for the book had become a contest and Donna intended winning.
Life and death.
Win or lose.
There was no turning back now, even if she wanted to.
Life or death.
She looked at the guns.
Seventy
‘Farrell, he's dying.’
‘What do you want me to do about it?’
‘Help him.’
Brian Kellerman looked down at Frank Stark, then at Farrell.
Stark was lying on his back in the motel room, his shirt open to reveal the bullet wound close to his navel.
Blood pumped slowly from the hole, which was tinged black and purple at the edges.
Kellerman himself looked bad.
His nose was little more than a bloodied lump and the bruising around his left eye was so severe he could barely see out of it.
He had two or three minor cuts and  grazes on his cheeks; they looked as if someone had pulled a fork through the flesh.
On the other bed in the double room of the Travelodge David Ryker sat, head bowed, hands clapped to both sides of his skull.
Every now and then he would spit blood onto the carpet.
He had bandaged his cut hand so tightly his fingers were beginning to go numb.
He touched his shattered front teeth with his other hand, feeling part of one smashed incisor come free.
He spat out enamel and blood.
Farrell was sitting at the table in the room, thumbing 9mm bullets into two magazines for the UZI.
Each held thirty-two rounds.
Fucking women, he thought, pushing the high calibre shells into the box magazine.
Fucking bloody women.
They were spoiling everything, those two troublesome cunts.
He gritted his teeth, loading the bullets more quickly.
Jesus, he'd make them pay.
Especially Ward's wife.
That fucking bitch would wish she'd never seen the book or him or anything to do with it.
He'd put a bullet in her brain himself.
No, he'd put several in.
Hold the UZI against the base of her skull and let rip.
Blow her fucking head right off.
Turn her face and head into confetti.
He slammed the full magazine into the weapon and gripped it for a moment, the veins in his temple throbbing angrily.
On the bed Stark groaned loudly and clapped hands to the wound.
‘We've got to do something about him,’ snapped Kellerman.
‘Have you got any suggestions?’
Farrell wanted to know ‘Do you want to call the ambulance yourself?
Why not call the police, while you're at it?
Tell them how he was shot.
What he was doing –when that crazy mare put three fucking bullets in him.
Go on, call them.’
He banged his fist down on the table and glared at Kellerman.
‘We'll have to leave him here,’ said Ryker, probing another loose tooth.
‘And when he's found?’
Kellerman asked.
‘What then?’
‘We'll be long gone,’ Farrell said.
‘There's nothing to link him to us.
We'll take his ID with us so they won't be able to identify him.’
Stark coughed, a sticky flux of phlegm and blood spilling over his lips.
The movement made the pain worse and he groaned even more loudly.
Farrell regarded the man impassively.
‘I didn't expect them to have guns,’ said Kellerman, gazing down at his stricken, companion.
Farrell didn't answer.
Ryker got to his feet and wandered into the bathroom.
He inspected the damage to his mouth again, wincing as he saw just how much destruction Julie had wrought with the hammer.
His lip was torn, a flap of skin hanging uselessly from it.
The area between his gashed top lip and his nose was heavily bruised.
Blood had congealed on his other front teeth; when he licked his tongue back and forth he could taste the coppery tang.
He  allowed a long streamer of mucus to hang from his mouth, watching as it struck the white enamel of the sink and trickled slowly into the plughole, leaving a crimson slick behind it.
‘So we leave him here?’
Kellerman protested.
‘Just leave him to die…’
‘Do you want to stay with him?’ hissed Farrell, turning the UZI on Kellerman.
‘Do you?’
Kellerman looked at the dying man, then stepped away from the bed.
‘What about the women?
Do we go back there?
Try again?’
Ryker asked, returning from the bathroom, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
Farrell shook his head.
‘We follow them.
Let them lead us to it.
Then we'll take care of them.’
He stroked the short barrel of the sub-machine gun.
His eyes strayed to the telephone.
The other two men saw him looking at it.
‘What makes you think they'll try t– get it?’
Ryker asked.
‘After what happened tonight they might have had enough.’
‘This isn't over until we've got that book.
Besides, Ward's wife will want to get her hands on it.
She's stubborn, like her fucking old man was.
She won't give up now.’
He looked at the phone again then lifted the receiver, aware that his hand was shaking.
He dialled the number and waited.
Seventy-One
Julie Craig sat at the wheel of the Fiesta, her head bowed.
She sucked in a deep breath then looked up, squeezing her eyelids tightly together as if to clear the fuzziness which clouded her vision.
But it wasn't her vision that was affected, she realized; it was her mind.
She felt as if someone had wrapped her thoughts in a blanket Reasoning seemed difficult; actions were a major effort.
‘Do you want me to drive?’
Donna asked, looking across at her sister.
‘No, it's okay,’ Julie replied, starting the engine.
The rain slowed to a fine drizzle which hung over the countryside like a dirty curtain.
The yard in front of the house and the dirt track were little more than liquid mud.
The rear wheels of the Fiesta spun, trying to gain purchase in the sucking ooze.
Finally Julie stepped harder on the accelerator and the vehicle moved off.
She flicked on the windscreen wipers.
One of them squeaked but neither woman seemed to notice the irritating sound.
Both kept their eyes fixed firmly ahead.
Donna dared not settle herself too comfortably into her seat in case she dozed off.
She doubted she'd had more than three hours sleep the previous night, and Julie only a little more.
It showed, too; despite their make-up, they both looked pale and wan.
Donna had managed to disguise the worst of the bruising on her top lip beneath some foundation cream and a little rouge had given at least some artificial colour to her cheeks, but as she pulled down the sun-visor on the driver's side and peered into the mirror she realized she looked as tired as she felt.
She had no idea how long the drive into Portsmouth would take.
Two hours, perhaps less?
The road conditions and Julie's emotional state weren't going to help.
Again Donna asked if she should drive but Julie merely shook her head.
‘This man at the waxworks,’ she said.
‘What's his name?
Paxton?
Have you ever met him?’
‘No, but Chris got on well with him.
He helped him a lot with research about the history of the building, how the models are made, that sort of thing.’
She sighed.
‘Chris must have trusted him in order to hide the Grimoire there.’
No one is to be trusted.
‘But he didn't say whereabouts he hid it?’
‘No.
I doubt if Paxton knows either,’ Donna said, looking at the piece of paper she'd collected the day before.
Beside the address of the waxworks, it also had two phone numbers.
One she guessed was the owner's home number; as it was Sunday, she might well need it.
Off season, she doubted if the attraction would be open.
It was hardly the weather to attract day-trippers, either.
‘So what do we do when we find it?’
Julie asked.
‘I wish I knew,’ Donna confessed.
‘Read it?’
She smiled thinly.
She glanced at the dashboard clock.
1.56 p.m.
By the time they reached the outskirts of Portsmouth the rain had practically stopped, but the sky was still slate grey and threatening.
There wasn't much traffic on the roads until they approached the city centre, and then roads became a little more clogged.
Julie had cold air blowing into the car in an effort to keep them both alert.
The crushing weariness was a formidable enemy, though, and she felt her eyelids drooping as if they'd been weighted.
‘I'm going to have to stop for a while, Donna,’ she said finally.
‘I'm practically driving asleep.’
‘I know how you feel,’ her sister said, pointing at something up ahead.
‘There's a cafe there.
Let's get a coffee.’
Julie checked the rear-view mirror and prepared to swing the car across the road into a parking space.
At the last moment she stopped the manoeuvre and drove on instead.
Donna looked at her in bewilderment.
‘I thought you were stopping,’ she said.
Julie didn't answer, but drove on towards the traffic lights, glancing again in the rear-view mirror.
They were amber as she swung the car round to the right and through them, heading down a side street, taking another right then another until they were back on the street where they'd started.
‘I appreciate the tour of the block,’ said Donna, smiling, ‘but what's wrong?’
‘We're being followed,’ Julie said flatly.
Donna's smile faded immediately.
She sat forward so that she could see into the Fiesta's wing mirror.
‘How can you be sure?’ she wanted to know.
‘Because whoever's driving went through a red light to keep up with us.’
‘Which car?’
‘The Granada,’ Julie said, and Donna saw the dark blue vehicle behind them.
‘What shall I do?’
Julie asked.
‘Pull in,’ Donna said unhesitatingly.
‘See what he does.’
Julie nodded, indicated again and this time swung the car into a gap in front of the cafe.
The Granada drove past, disappearing around a corner.
‘They spotted me,’ Brian Kellerman said into the two-way radio.
‘Where are they now?’
Farrell wanted to know.
Kellerman told him.
‘All right, we'll follow them from here.
You keep out the way.
I'll let you know where we're heading, but keep back.
If they spot you again we might lose them.
’ Farrell switched the two-way off and jammed it into the seat pocket beside him.
He gave Ryker directions, then sat back in his seat.
‘Now we'll see,’ he murmured.
Seventy-Two
They sat at a window table in the cafe looking out, watching every car that passed.
Donna warmed her hands round her tea and glanced at her watch again.
4.26 p.m.
They'd been in the cafe for over thirty minutes now, with only the sound of a fruit machine and the loud chattering of a group of youngsters in their late teens for company.
A couple were playing the fruit machine; every so often, a cacophony of bells and buzzers would go off.
The place smelt of damp clothes and cigarette smoke.
There were a few curled-up sandwiches in a glass-fronted cabinet beneath the counter and a cheese roll that looked like it had been hewn from granite rather than baked with dough.
Bottles of Coke, Tizer and Pepsi were lined up, along with a few token bottles of Perrier and Evian.
The Formica-topped tables were scarred with cigarette burns and discoloured by spilled coffee.
A woman in her forties was busily scrubbing tables at the far end.
Donna thought she would need more than hot, soapy water to remove the accumulated grime.
Julie did not take her gaze from the window.
Every vehicle that passed she scanned, every passer-by she scrutinised.
The Granada hadn't been past.
But it could be lurking up ahead somewhere, Julie reasoned, waiting to continue its pursuit.
Or worse.
‘We can't sit here forever,’ Donna said finally.
‘Come on.’
‘They could be waiting,’ Julie said warily.
‘We'll take that chance.’
As she opened her handbag to retrieve her purse, Julie saw the Pathfinder .22 nestling inside.
Donna paid for the teas and the two women walked out to the Fiesta and got in.
Julie's hand was shaking as she pushed the key into the ignition but she sucked in a deep breath and started the car, checking her rear-view mirror both for approaching traffic and, more particularly, for that Granada.
‘How much further?’ she wanted to know.
Donna consulted the directions on the sheet of paper and realized that they must be pretty close to their destination.
She checked street names carefully, peering at a sign indicating an approaching roundabout.
She pointed to the turn-off they should take.
‘We're close now,’ Donna said.
They were still on the outskirts of the city centre itself and Donna wondered what something as strange as a waxworks was doing so far from the city centre, even what it was doing in a place like Portsmouth.
She could understand the existence of such an attraction at a seaside resort, but this traditionally nautical stronghold could hardly be classified  as such.
She wondered how Paxton made it pay.
‘There,’ Donna suddenly shouted, jabbing a finger against the glass.
Julie looked to her left and caught a glimpse of what looked like a large terraced house fronted by a blue and white canvas awning.
There was a small paved area in front of it and a low wall.
The paved area had several figures on it.
A ticket booth was guarded by two of these figures dressed as policemen.
HOUSE OF WAX proclaimed the sign on the awning.
The shutters were firmly closed at the ticket booth, the waxwork policemen staring with sightless eyes at passers-by.
The street was more or less deserted.
There were more shutters at the windows of the building, only one of which was open.
Leaning out of it the figure of Charlie Chaplin waved to anyone who cared to look up, frozen forever in that pose.
‘Now what?’
Julie asked, seeing that the place was closed.
‘Let's find a phone box,’ Donna said.
‘I'll call Paxton.’
They finally found one two streets away.
Julie pulled in and her sister ran across to the two booths, pulling the piece of paper from her handbag, finding Paxton's number.
She touched the .22 Pathfinder for reassurance as she removed the sheet.
The first phone was broken and the second took only phone cards.
Donna rummaged in her purse and found hers.
She pushed it into the slot and dialled, dismayed to see she only had six units left.
She hoped he picked up the phone quickly.
She hoped he was there.
The phone continued to ring.
‘Come on,’ she muttered.
Another unit was swallowed up.
The phone was picked up.
‘Hello,’ the voice said.
‘Mr Paxton?
George Paxton?’
‘Yes.
Who's this, please?’
Another unit disappeared.
‘I'm in a call box, I can't speak for long, just listen to me, please.
My name is Donna Ward, Chris Ward's wife.
You knew my husband very well; he wrote a book about waxworks and you helped him with his research.
He left something inside your waxworks.
He hid something.
A book.’
Silence at the other end as another unit was consumed.
‘Mr Paxton, I need your help, please.
It's very important.’
‘Where are you?’ he wanted to know.
‘In a call box, I told you.’
‘Meet me outside my waxworks in an hour, Mrs Ward,’ he said.
Donna hung up, left the phone card in the box and hurried back to the car.
Julie drove off.
‘We've got them,’ said Peter Farrell into the two-way.
He gave Kellerman the location.
‘Get here as quick as you can, but stay out of sight.
We don't want to fuck it up now.’
He looked at Ryker and nodded in the direction of the Fiesta.
‘Don't lose them, but be careful.’
Ryker guided the Orion into traffic, keeping well back from the Fiesta.
Farrell watched as the smaller car parked across the street from the waxworks.
He saw the two women sitting there as the Orion glided past and disappeared up a side street.
Satisfied that they were staying put, he flicked on the two-way again.
‘It's Farrell.
We've got them under surveillance.
They won't get away this time.’
‘We'll be there in about thirty minutes,’ the voice on the other end said, then there was a sharp hiss of static followed by silence.
Farrell reached inside his jacket, his fingers touching the butt of the .45 in his shoulder holster.
No escape, he thought, smiling.
Not this time.
Seventy-Three
The office was small, less than fifteen feet square, dominated by a large antique desk piled high with correspondence.
A glass paperweight in the shape  of a tortoise held the letters down.
Framed photos on the walls showed the front of the waxworks.
Set out in chronological order, the first picture had been taken in 1934, then, every ten years until the most recent one.
The building itself had changed little, apart from a lick of paint here and there; it still reminded Donna of a huge terraced house.
There were cabinets set against one wall, each filled with photos and biographical details from figures in history and the media, politics and sport — everyone from Clement Attlee to the Greek god Zeus.
‘My grandfather started the museum,’ said Paxton.
‘He saw a number of them in America when he visited during the Thirties.
When he died it was passed on to my father and then to me.
It doesn't make much money now, just enough to keep it running, but we break even every year.
I wouldn't want to close it down.’
Paxton smiled affectionately and touched the picture of the Wax Museum taken in 1934.
He was a tall, attractive man in his mid-forties, the grey hair at his temples giving him a distinguished look.
More so than the bald patch at the back of his head.
He wore an open-neck shirt and trousers that needed pressing, but he'd apologized for his ‘unkempt’ condition when he'd first greeted them, explaining that he'd been decorating at home and had pulled on the first things to hand in his haste to get to the waxworks.
‘We used to make all the figures here ourselves,’ he said.
‘There was a workshop in the basement.
My father employed three people to create them.
I don't need them any more.
I simply write to Madame Tussaud's and put in a list of requests for figures.’
He smiled.
‘They send me the ones I need.
They sometimes suggest figures I should have here.
You know, the ‘Famous for fifteen minutes’ type.
The pop stars, the TV celebrities or sportsmen.
I put them in my Warhol Gallery.
That's what I call it.’
He smiled again.
‘Everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes,’ he mused.
‘I usually replace them after a month or so.’
‘Mr Paxton, how well did you know my husband?’
Donna asked.
‘How well do any of us know someone else, Mrs Ward?’ he said philosophically.
‘I got on well with Chris while he was here doing his research.
He spent about a week with me, learning about the running of the place, things like that.’
‘How much did you know about the book he hid here?’
‘Nothing at all.
He rang me one day and asked if he could bring something down.
He wouldn't even tell me what it was over the phone.’
‘How long ago was that?’
Paxton shrugged.
‘Six or seven weeks,’ he said.
‘All he told me was that the book was important to him and to some other people.’
‘He didn't say which people?’
Donna interjected.
‘No.
He just asked if he could hide it in the museum.
I agreed.
He said he'd pick it up in a  month or so.
Then, of course…’
He allowed the sentence to trail off.
‘Did you see the book?
Do you know where he hid it?’
‘I haven't got a clue.
It could be anywhere in the museum.’
He paused for a moment, looking almost apologetically at Donna.
‘Would it be rude of me to ask who he was hiding it from?’
‘I'm not completely sure,’ Donna told him, ‘but I need to find it.’
She felt it unnecessary to mention some of the incidents that had taken place over the last few days, least of all the confrontation at the cottage the previous night.
She merely told him that the book bore a crest, an embossed crest of a hawk.
It was very old, too, she said.
‘I know that's vague,’ she said, ‘but it's all I know.’
‘I'd like to help you look if I can,’ Paxton volunteered.
Donna smiled.
‘That's very kind of you.
Thank you.’
Paxton slid open a drawer in his desk and took out what looked like a floor-by-floor plan of the three-storey building.
He laid the diagram out on the desk-top, weighting each corner down with a pile of papers.
‘The museum is divided into galleries,’ he said, jabbing the plan.
‘It makes it sound grand, doesn't it?
Museum.’
He chuckled.
‘My grandfather thought that wax museums should be places  of learning, too.
Three-dimensional temples of knowledge, he used to call them.’
Donna and Julie were more interested in the layout of the building than in Paxton's nostalgic musings.
‘Is this the ground floor?’
Donna asked, prodding one part of the map.
‘No, that's the basement.
It's where we keep our Chamber of Horrors.
No waxworks is complete without one.
It's always the most popular area, too.
It brings out the morbid streak in all of us, I'm afraid.’
‘And you've no idea where Chris could have hidden the book?’
Donna repeated.
‘None at all.’
‘We'll have more chance of finding it if we search separately,’ Donna suggested.
‘Julie and I will start on the top floor, then work our way down.’
‘I'll meet you on the second floor.
If we miss each other we'll meet back in this office in three hours.’
‘Miss each other?
Is that likely?’
Julie wanted to know.
‘There are two sets of stairs into and out of every gallery,’ Paxton explained, ‘So that if we get too many visitors it doesn't get too congested as people move around.
It's quite possible we could pass each other and not even realize it.
It's dark in the galleries, too, apart from the lights on the figures.’
Julie felt her heart beating faster.
‘If one of us finds the Grimoire, we call out to let the others know, then bring it back here to this office,’ Donna suggested.
Paxton nodded.
He left the office first, waiting for the two women to follow him out before closing the door again.
There was a flight of stairs directly to their right.
‘Follow the stairs straight up to the third floor,’ he said.
‘I'll go that way.’
He nodded in the direction of an archway.
Through it, Donna could see the first of many wax tableaux showing famous film stars.
The atmosphere was thick and gloomy.
She hugged her handbag tightly to her sides, comforted by the thought of the Pathfinder inside.
Two or three feet away, standing by the entrance to the waxworks, were the figures of Laurel and Hardy.
In the darkness they seemed not the amusing and-loveable clowns they were meant to be but somehow menacing.
Their glass eyes regarded the group blindly.
Julie again felt a shiver run up her spine.
She glanced up the stairs; the top of the flight almost disappeared into the dimness.
‘Back here in three hours,’ said Donna, her voice sounding loud in the unyielding silence.
‘Unless one of us finds the book.’
Paxton nodded.
They set off.
The hunt began.
Seventy-Four
Marilyn Monroe gave him no clues.
John Wayne offered no help.
Neither did Marlon Brando or any other member of the Corleone family.
Paxton stood in the middle of the tableau entitled: THE GODFATHER and moved between the figures of James Caan, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando, all of them identified by name plates at their feet.
In the display the Godfather's desk had a number of books on it; the waxworks owner reached for them one by one.
They were encyclopaedias or dictionaries with the dust jackets removed.
Not wax but real books.
The figure of Robert Duvall was holding a briefcase; he glanced inside but found nothing but a sheet of blank paper.
He moved on, past Indiana Jones and Rambo until he came to a display of THE EXORCIST.
It featured a bedroom and figures of Max Von Sydow, Jason Miller and Linda Blair in her possessed incarnation.
The waxwork of Von Sydow held what was supposed to be a Bible but Paxton wondered if Ward might have substituted the Grimoire for the Holy Book.
After all, he had no idea how big it was.
He stepped in amongst the  figures, moving around the bed until he reached the kneeling wax effigy.
The book it held was indeed a Bible.
Paxton moved on.
It wasn't just the silence Julie found overwhelming, it was the claustrophobic atmosphere of the place.
The solitude and the almost palpable darkness combined to create the feeling that they'd been draped in a blanket.
The carpeting of the floors served to enhance the illusion; they could not even hear their own footsteps as they moved around.
Julie walked quickly, keeping within two or three feet of Donna.
Even so, her sister was a barely glimpsed shadow most of the time.
They passed through an archway into a display of great sporting figures.
The waxworks were arranged in groups beyond a rope, which was supposed to separate them from their admirers.
In a mock-up of a boxing ring stood Henry Cooper, Mohammed Ali and Mike Tyson.
At the edge of the ring Joe Louis and Rocky Marciano glared glassily at her.
Julie found herself drawn almost hypnotically to the blank stares.
She could see herself reflected in the glass orbs, a distorted image.
Ahead, Donna was standing beside Peĺe and George Best.
Kenny Dalglish and Eusebio looked on impassively.
Johan Cruyff, one foot perched on a football, regarded her with the same emotionless expression as the rest.
Further along there was a model of Sir Francis Chichester; on what was supposed to be the deck of his yacht lay a number of books.
Donna climbed into the exhibit and began inspecting them.
She found to her annoyance that they were all books about sailing.
She pressed on.
Julie followed, her passage unnoticed by Lester Piggot and Willie Carson.
A flight of three steps led up into another gallery, this one depicting great artists.
They moved on.
Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton stood around Paxton as he searched through the drawers of M's desk, but the James Bond tableau was no help to him either.
So many places to look.
So many places Ward could have hidden the book.
As he walked among the figures Paxton wondered what could be so important about this missing book.
What could be so vital to send him and two women trekking around the place?
Opposite him a display showed Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers all dancing together, watched by a group of admiring figures.
One of the figures was of a child; at its feet were a set of school books.
He strode across to it, climbing into the little set-up.
The child was Shirley Temple and the books were spilling from her satchel.
He began sorting through them.
Danny Kaye, Liza Minnelli and Judy Garland  looked on blankly as he sifted through the books.
Again he found nothing.
The hand grabbed his hair.
So surprised by the movement he felt as if his vocal cords had frozen, Paxton hardly moved as his head was yanked hard backwards.
The knife flashed in the spotlight, glinting viciously before the razor-sharp blade was drawn across his throat.
Blood erupted from the wound that opened like a grinning mouth, spewing crimson over the lifeless figures.
Peter Farrell held tightly to Paxton's hair, careful to avoid the jetting blood.
He heard the soft hiss as the waxwork owner's sphincter muscle collapsed.
Then he allowed the body to drop to the floor, watching it twitch for a second before stepping back into the shadows from which he'd emerged.
He pulled a two-way radio from his pocket and flicked it on.
‘I'm on the ground floor,’ he whispered into the machine.
‘Paxton's dead.
Split up and find the other two.’
He paused a moment, still looking down at the body, the head in the centre of a spreading pool of blood.
‘Keep them alive until I get there,’ he added as an afterthought.
He put the two-way back in his pocket and slipped away, swallowed by the gloom.
Behind him, Paxton's body lay amongst the frozen dancers and entertainers smiling down blankly as if welcoming him.
Blood from the hideous wound washed over  the title plate of the tableau, which proclaimed happily:
GOTTA DANCE.
Seventy-Five
Second floor.
The top storey had yielded nothing.
Outside, the rain which had been falling when they entered the building seemed to have eased.
Night had invaded the heavens, closing around the waxworks like a black fist as impenetrable as the umbra that seemed to fill every inch of the museum.
The exhibits were small islands of light within a sea of shadows.
Donna paused at the bottom of the flight of steps and looked to her right and left.
To her right was a gallery featuring GREAT EVENTS IN WORLD HISTORY; to her left, THE ENTERTAINMENT WORLD.
‘Do you want to check one side and I'll check the other?’ she asked Julie.
‘No.
I–m staying with you,’ the younger woman said, horrified at the thought of being alone in one of these darkened rooms.
Donna gripped her hand briefly to reassure her, but the gesture did little to ease Julie's fear.
Donna, too, felt the hairs on the back of her neck rise as they moved into the right-hand gallery.
A mock-up of the front benches of the House of Commons displayed a dozen of the country's most important politicians.
Behind them were older, more famous ones.
Gladstone, Disraeli and Lloyd George all stood in judgement, silent and unmoving as the two women passed by.
The next exhibit showed Napoleon–s final trip to St Helena.
He was in a cabin on board the ship with several figures standing around him.
There were books on the desk at which the effigy of the Emperor sat.
Donna wasted no time checking them out.
Julie, meantime, took a couple of paces across the gallery towards a group of world leaders, past and present, gathered around a desk.
She shivered as she felt so many sightless eyes boring into her.
A board creaked beneath her feet and she sucked in a startled breath.
Adolf Hitler stood, arms folded, beside Benito Mussolini.
Stalin and Trotsky stood to their left.
Julie could see bookshelves behind them.
The Grimoire could be there.
‘Donna,’ she whispered.
No reply.
She looked round to where her sister was searching through the other books.
‘Donna,’ Julie repeated.
There was no sign of the older woman.
Julie felt as if someone had suddenly pumped her full of ice water.
‘Oh, Jesus,’ she murmured, fearing she was alone.
‘Donna.’
She raised her voice slightly.
There was a chipboard wall between the exhibits and Julie turned and moved towards it.
She could hear sounds on the other side.
The breath was stuck in her throat and her mouth felt dry.
It was if someone had filled it with sand.
In the deafening silence inside the gallery she could hear her heart thumping madly against her ribs.
‘Donna,’ she said again, the word sounding thunderous in the solitude.
Close by a floorboard creaked.
Julie swallowed hard.
‘It's not here.’
Donna stuck her head out from behind the chipboard wall.
Julie just managed to stifle a scream.
She raised a hand to her forehead and let out a breath which seemed to empty her lungs.
‘For Christ's sake,’ she murmured.
Donna saw the exhibit her sister had been looking at and crossed to it.
She looked up at the books on the shelves and reached for the closest.
She flipped it open.
Blank paper.
So was the next.
And the next.
Every book on the shelf was a volume of blank sheets.
Donna sighed wearily and prepared to continue the search.
Julie suddenly grabbed her arm.
‘Listen,’ she whispered, her eyes bulging in their sockets.
‘What…’
‘Just listen.’
They stood as motionless as the wax figures surrounding them, ears alert for the slightest sound, eyes roving around the darkened gallery for any trace of movement.
Donna heard it too.
The unmistakable creaking of floorboards.
Someone was on the floor above them.
‘It must be Paxton,’ Donna said quietly.
‘He was below us,’ Julie protested.
‘He said that we could pass each other without knowing.
Perhaps he went up to double check, in case we missed something.’
The footsteps receded.
The two women remained motionless, gazing up at the ceiling as if to trace the source and direction of the footsteps.
There was one more protesting creak, then silence.
‘I'm sorry,’ said Julie none too convincingly.
‘This place…
’ She allowed the sentence to trail off.
Donna squeezed her hand and nodded.
They paused a moment longer, then moved further down the gallery, inspecting each exhibit, checking any books which could be the hidden  Grimoire.
Finally satisfied that these tableaux held no secrets, they turned round and headed back towards the gallery marked THE ENTERTAINMENT WORLD.
At the top of the stairs between the two galleries Donna paused and peered into the thick shadows, listening for movement from either above or below.
She heard nothing.
She wondered if she should call out to Paxton, just to find out where he was.
She decided against it and walked through the archway to be confronted by the figure of Elvis Presley.
Julie followed, past the cast of Dallas, glancing at figures of Rod Stewart, Tina Turner and Madonna.
So many eyes watching them.
These exhibits were mostly just single figures, not set out in any kind of tableau, but isolated in their stage clothes with just a name plate for company.
Kate Bush stood defiantly before them, her hair frozen in an imaginary breeze, curling in the air like the deadly locks of a Gorgon.
Bob Hope was leaning on a golf club.
Frank Sinatra was holding a microphone.
Donna moved quickly through the gallery.
‘There's nothing in here,’ she said.
‘Let's try the next floor.
Perhaps Paxton's found something.’
‘He would have called, wouldn't he?’
Julie enquired.
‘Perhaps we didn't hear him.’
At the top of the stairs just beyond the archway at the exit from the gallery stood figures of Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder.
The former of the two was in a glass case.
Donna moved close to it, peering in at the finely sculpted features, momentarily distracted by the sheer artistry of the effigy.
She and Julie moved nearer to the glass.
Julie touched it.
The figure turned and looked at them.
Seventy-Six
Julie could not suppress a scream this time.
Her shriek of surprise echoed around the building, drumming in their ears, amplified by the stillness.
The figure turned stiffly and fixed them in a sightless gaze.
It took Donna a moment or two to realize that it had been activated by some kind of electric eye.
When the glass was touched, the mechanism was set in motion.
The figure swayed slightly on its base, then was still.
Julie ran a hand through her hair and closed her eyes, her heart racing.
‘Oh God,’ she murmured.
Donna too felt her heart thumping; the sudden shock made her tremble.
She squeezed Julie's  hand and motioned for her to follow down the stairs that led to the ground floor.
They were halfway down when the thought struck her.
Why had Paxton not come to find the source of the scream?
Why, at least, had he not called out?
There was no question of him hearing the noise in the stillness of the waxworks.
Where the hell was he?
Perhaps they had been his footsteps they'd heard above them earlier.
But even so, why had he not come running to find out what was happening?
Donna licked her tongue across her dry lips and stopped at the bottom of the stairs.
Julie joined her.
‘What now?’
Julie wanted to know.
Donna glanced across into the gallery on the ground floor then at another doorway ahead of them marked PRIVATE.
She crossed to the door and found that it was unlocked.
It opened out onto a narrow flight of stone steps.
There was a cloying fusty smell rising from below, like drying clothes.
It was cold in the narrow stairwell; the metal banister was freezing when she touched it.
‘Come on,’ she said.
‘This must lead to the basement.’
She began to descend, and Julie followed.
They trod carefully on the bare stone until, finally, Donna pushed open the door at the bottom and stepped out.
The smell here was even stronger.
The odour  of decay as well as damp was strong in her nostrils.
She looked round.
The door from which they had emerged was also marked PRIVATE.
To the left was a light, well-illuminated area that contained various electronic games and fruit machines.
To the right, a set of steps led down into what looked like seething blackness.
The darkness was so total that she wondered if they would even be able to proceed without the aid of a torch.
There was a sign on the wall beside this entrance:
ALL THOSE WISHING TO LEAVE THE WAXWORKS HERE, KINDLY USE THE APPROPRIATE EXIT.
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUNG CHILDREN OR THOSE OF A NERVOUS DISPOSITION LEAVE NOW.
Donna took a step closer to the top of the steps and peered down.
There were five stone stairs leading down to a wooden floor and a narrow stone corridor.
The smell of damp and rot seemed to waft from the doorway as if expelled from putrid lungs.
There was a sign just inside the doorway, suspended from the ceiling by two rusty chains.
Donna read it aloud.
‘Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.’
She smiled.
‘It would have been just like Chris to hide the Grimoire down there,’ Donna said, pointing towards the abyss beyond the steps.
‘It would have appealed to his sense of humour.’
‘What is it?’
Julie wanted to know, wrinkling her nose at the smell.
Donna raised her eyebrows.
‘The Chamber of Horrors.’
