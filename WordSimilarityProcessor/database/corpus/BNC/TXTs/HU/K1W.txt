A pleasure steamer has made the first day trip down the Severn to the Devon coast for almost a century.
More than six hundred passengers boarded the Balmoral for the cruise.
The boat is the last of the White Funnel fleet which has plied the Bristol Channel since Victorian times.

They came from all over Gloucestershire for a typical Victorian day out…a trip on a steamer to the seaside resort of Ilfracombe.Six hundred and fifty climbed aboard the Balmoral at Lydney dock…making the most of the chance of a lifetime.After all the last pleasure boat to attract the crowds down to Lydney dock for a trip to Devon was the paddle steamer Ravenswood in 1893.
The Balmoral is run by a charitable trust dedicated to preserving old steamers:

Then it was time to cast off and manoeuvre gently away from the dock.We were at last ready to head down the River Severn and onwards into the Bristol Channel.Our safe passage was in the hands of Severn pilot Pete Tippet:

You never know the River Severn…and it can always catch you out.

In no time we were a mile from either bank…and the daytrippers were thoroughly enjoying themselves.Even one couple who should have been cruising down the Seine were happy with the alternative:
You can't please everyone though…one youngster was obviously unimpressed.
Meanwhile for ship's captain Kit Lee from the Forest of Dean, it was good to be in familiar waters:

Now to another in our occasional series’ In Praise of Folly’.
Folly builders always put making an impression and deceiving the eye ahead of any practical considerations.
One folly was so outlandish it never got past the planning stage — others are still fooling people to this day…

These gothic ruins behind the council offices in Abingdon have been deceiving visitors for over a century.
There was a Benedictine abbey here in the middle ages — the arches are assumed by many visitors and local people to be all that's left of the abbey.
In fact they're a fraud — the arches were brought over from nearby St. Helen's Church when part of the church was pulled down, by a Mr Trendall in eighteen-sixty.
He had them erected in the grounds of his house — now council offices.
The stone surrounding the arches is genuine Victorian stonework…not the crumbling medieval relic it's mistaken for…
Just a few miles west in the grounds of Nuneham Conference Park stands another folly which has ended up in an unexpected place.
This is Carfax Conduit — an ornate monument topped with an elaborate octagonal turret with carved figures in niches and gargoyles at the corners.
The letters’ O N’around the top of the parapet are the initials of its builder, Otho Nicholson.
What most visitors who admire it don't know is that its original home was the middle of Oxford town centre — just below Carfax tower — with traffic flowing around it from all directions.
After it was removed to make more space, it was given to the Earl of Harcourt who'd been planning to build a gothic folly in the grounds of his Nuneham Courtney estate.
Instead, he had the conduit put up on the site of the planned folly in eighteen eighty-seven, where it's been ever since.
Jonathan Madden is a would-be twentieth century folly builder who's been thwarted by town planners.
When he was an undergraduate at Christchurch in nineteen seventy-five, he and a friend, Tim Sanderson, decided to put up the biggest folly in the world in Christchurch meadow:
Male speaker
We wanted to build a pyramid that was going to be slightly bigger than the biggest pyramid in Egypt.
It was going to be 586 feet high, with 900 feet long sides.
And it was going to be just over there in the meadow.
Voice over
The thousands of tons of earth which were to be dug out of the meadow to make room for the foundations were to be piled up in nearby Merton playing field.
The four hundred and ninety-five thousand lorry loads of stone needed to build the pyramid which the students planned as their mausoleum, were to come from Headington quarry.
And labour would be no problem.
Male speaker
We were going to suggest second year undergraduates were conscripted to build it.
It would have taken 25 years to complete and required the Thames to be frozen over for about seventeen years, to prevent the river flooding the deep foundations.
Voice over
Negotiations were begun with the city's town planners, who bombarded the students with letters and forms to fill in.
After two months, they finally voted the plans out by five votes to four — their reasons included an objection to the height of the pyramid and the effect it would have on the view of the city, the loss of trees in the meadow and the huge shadow it would cast over most of Oxford.
Male speaker
We weren't entirely surprised.
But when I think it would have been just eight years from completion now, up to a height of about 400 feet, I think it's sad we didn't get permission to build it.

Home baked ham…a favourite with shoppers at delicatessen counters.
Experts say this is the right way to store and display it.
Kept in clean cabinets, all surfaces regularly wiped…and temperatures kept to below 8 degrees centigrade.
But a survey by Which magazine has found that up to eighty per cent of loose ham sold in delicatessens was contaminated with bacteria.
Supermarkets, including Tesco's store in Banbury and the Co-Op in Kidlington, were also found to be selling ham, which experts say had a high risk of food poisoning.
Inspectors also found listeria contamination in pre-packed ham bought from Sainsbury's in Cowley.
The Consumers'Association blames poor hygiene standards.
Delicatessen managers say it's vital to maintain clean practices from the moment supplies come to the store.
Supermarkets listed by the survey have hit back.
All say their own tests showed no evidence of listeria.
The Co-Op says it regularly carries testing of equipment.
Staff are well trained and stores are constantly monitored by environmental health officers.
Sainsbury's says it has a strict listeria code of practice and is confident that standards of hygiene are effective.
But the Consumers' Association wants tougher action on food hygiene, to fully protect consumers from the risk of food poisoning.

Eight firebombs were planted but only three went off.
The others were found and defused just in time.

Here, a family of three died…last year four people from the same family died a few miles furtehr east.
Fifty-five people have been killed in the last twelve years.
Campaigners say its a death trap
The county council acknowledge its a dangerous road and are now urging the department of transport to take action.
They believe the heavy traffic must be eased…and forced to slow down…
Today the department of transport said only that it ontinues to support the council's road safety measures.
But there's no hope for a fifty mile an hour limit along the whole road because some sections have already been made dual carriageway.
Other improvements are also under way.
But the long term aim is to make it all dual carriageway…hopes are high the government will announce this in a couple of years.
In the meantime, engineers and campaigners hope any and every measure available will persuade drivers to take extra care.

The offshore championship is held over 10 rounds off the coast of Britain…the races can be anything up to a 100 miles…today its the Eastbourne Grand Prix…there's not a deckchair to be had on the pier…its standing room only as thousands roll up to watch the big boats bouncing their way through the water…
Andre says it is dangerous but you have to have respect for the sea it can be hard and punishing…
Mike says everything is bouncing up and down but he doesn't know why he does it…after today's race he will not be able to get out of bed in the morning because he'll be so bruised
And true to form Flippin Shytalk roars across the line to win again…the National Championship should be their's this summer…they defy the dangers week in week out…there's no money to be won just fun to be had…

Farms are a soft target for arsonists, according to a report which says that up to a third of farm fires are caused deliberately.
Insurers are warning that if farmers don't take extra precautions they'll end up paying higher premiums and putting their livelihoods at risk.

Now a report by the Association of British Insurers, commissioned by the National Farmers Union, warns that the problem continues to grow.
Ironically, the recent ban on straw- and stubble-burning hasn't helped.
Having more combustible straw around only means more fuel for the arsonist.
This year Gloucestershire's fire service has had to deal with 16 per cent more arsons at farms than last year…and farm fires by their very nature aren't the easiest to deal with.
But the ABI report suggests several ways in which farmers can help to protect their property.
Meanwhile farmers have no option but to fork out the ever-increasing premiums that insurers are demanding.
The recession has hit the farming community as hard as anyone — and the last thing farmers want to see is their livelihood going up in smoke.

This old mill beside a stream, near Malvern in Worcestershire, was grinding corn long before the Victorians discovered Nellie Dean.
The miller's house, with a smaller water wheel, was used for threshing clover in the 16th century.
The five storey corn mill, built in 1820, was still working in the 1970's when the house and mill were discovered by sculptor Anne Campbell.
She turned one of the barns into her studio.
Her bronzes are selling so well in Paris that she's selling up to move to France…putting her unique English home on the market.
The four bedroomed millers house and the mill itself are listed buildings.
The mill machinery is still intact, including original wooden toothed driving wheels, and a grindstone powered by leather belts from the millrace.
Archers Mill, named after the last miller who lived there, is on the market for less than some four bedroomed homes on a modern estate, two hundred and fifty thousand pounds.
So who's going to buy it?
This old mill by the stream will no doubt inspire other artists, painters, maybe even a songwriter.

The Bishop of Oxford is calling for tough military action to end the suffering in the former Yugoslavia.
He says the West has failed the war-torn republics, and must now intervene.
But a United Nations expert from Oxford University says action could lead to a holy war.

These are just the latest shocking images from the embattled Yogoslavian republics…leading to even more frustration and anger in western europe.
But they're scenes which could have been avoided according the the bishop of Oxford, if we'd listened to warnings and intervened early on.
Now he says there must be direct military action
But others say military action could end in disaster.
Professor Adam Roberts, an expert on the United Nations, says without a clear goal intervention could backfire.
Whatever happens in Bosnia the Bishop says we must beef up the role of the UN forces.
Everyone agrees the republics need all the parctical help they can get to stop them tearing themselves apart.
A hospital has been criticised for the way it treated a seventy nine year old woman who had cancer.
A confidential report has revealed the woman was prepared three times for an operation she didn't need.
When she was discharged, she had to go home alone because no one had told her family.

The woman who was seventy nine and a widow became the victim of a series of errors by medical staff shortly after entering the Princess Margaret Hospital in Swindon in September 1990.
She was suffering from severe stomach pains, vomiting and diarroea.
She was tested for cancer.
Then came mistake number one: She was discharged from hospital and left to return to her empty house without anyone telling her family.
Two weeks later she was admitted to St Margaret's hospital, where mistake number two was made.
A locum consultant failed to spot the result of her earlier test and arranged for a totally unnecessary exploratory operation.
This was cancelled three times because of her worsening state.
Again, her family were not told of the seriousness of the condition until a month later and just days defore she died.
Her case only came to light because the Health Authority meeting were mistakenly sent to the media.
Health Authority watchdogs say although such a case is rare, it is by no means unique.
A spokesman for the District Health Authority said:’ We are very sorry this has happened.
We are reviewing the lessons to be learned.’

The sport still claims to be the fastest-growing in Britain…and enthusiasts came from all corners of the country for the grand finale of the National Mountain Bike Championships — the quest to find the British champion.
For those with a chance of winning — like Mark James from Hereford — it's the most important race in the calendar.
The challenge ahead…5 laps, each more than 6 miles long, of the most inhospitable terrain in the Malvern Hills.
The first big test…the hill they call The Lungbuster…and that's just for starters.
Mountain bikers have a motto — don't stop till you reach the top — but it's no fun 2 hours into a gruelling race.
And as limbs tire, concentration tends to lapse…
Eventually this year's winners in both the men's and women's races turn out to be the same as last year's.
They even had the audacity to complain that the course wasn't tough enough.
Mark James would have preferred more hills, too — he was disappointed to have finished halfway down his class.
For others, blistered and saddle-sore, just reaching the finishing line sufficed.
At least they now have twelve months to recover in time for next year's race.
there's just five days to go to the start of the new football season…it's the big kick-off this Saturday…and both Swindon and Oxford were warming up at the weekend 
at the manor ground United lost 2-0 to Queens Park Rangers…

The 9 others in the dock face a combination of charges ranging from conspiracy to pervert the course of justice to assault.
So many defendants have been squeezed into court that extra benches were needed to make one large dock.
The charges arise from an incident last January during which an off duty police officer was allegedly hit with a hammer while he waited for a taxi in Cheltenham.

Rebecca Frak was found guilty last month of common assault.
Swindon Magistrates were told she'd lost her temper and punched 88-year-old Sarah Fribbins in the eye.
The incident happened in February last year, while Frak was working at the Ashbury Lodge Nursing Home in Marlborough Road in Swindon.
She'd denied the charge.
Today Swindon Magistrates sentenced her to 3 months' imprisonment.
Bench chairwoman Ann Middleton told Frak the offence was so serious that prison was the only way of dealing with it, because the public needed protecting from her.
You were a professional nurse, she said, and yet you assaulted an old woman who was blind, confused and bed-ridden.
Frak was sacked from her job at Ashbury Lodge before she was convicted.
Today the nursing home said it's pleased the whole episode is over.
Frak still maintains that she's innocent, and that Mrs Fribbins made the story up.
She's now expected to lodge an appeal.

A controversial memo to hospital consultants has been withdrawn after claims it was creating a two-tier health system.

But some doctors say while the memo may have been withdrawn, the unfairness remains.

Dr RICHARD THORNE/Non-Fundholding GP
COLIN JONES/Nuffield Hospital Trust
It's now been replaced with this memo, saying the first was poorly worded and stressing that MRI scans at the Nuffield will be carried out according to on a purely medcial decisionmedical need.
Dr Richard Thorne whose practice is not fund holding says it reinforces his fear that the system is two-tier…
He says it is already.
There's no point in the fund holding system unless there is a two tier system.
There's no point in going through that trauma unless you can buy a better service.
The Nuffield hospital says sessions on the scanner are allocated first according to urgency, and then according to who's placed contracts for scans with the hospital.
GP fund holders placed contracts for more MRI sessions than the district health authority…so their patients have a better chance of being seen quickly…in about three weeks instead of about four months.But hospital managers deny that means two types of care…
He says it's not the case at all.
All patients are treated in terms of clinical priority.
Urgent cases are seen whether we have the funds or not.
What we're talking about here is other patients.
So what we're trying to do is ensure the service is delivered as the purchasing agencies require.
He says I'm not convinced at all.
I think clinical need is often influenced by the thickness of somebody's big wallet.
But with about 4000 MRI scans carried out each year radiologists insist they'll be allocated to whoever needs them most.

She'd entered and won a competiton run by a local photographer, Colin Wakeham.
The fly sheet giving details of how to enter had promised that the winner would open a local shop and launch a car.
So Louise got quite a shock when, flicking through the local paper she saw that ANOTHER girl had been crowned carnival queen.
The OTHER carnival queen, Vicky Cooper got her title from the Forest of Dean carnival committee.
So she's the official carnival queen.
Vicky was equally staggered to hear she had a rival.
We went to see Colin Wakeham to ask him on whose authority he'd run the competiton.
Despite her disappointment, Louise wishes Vicky well.
Vicky will appear in the Cinderford Carnival next Saturday.
She might even make room for Louise on her float.

You can't miss the letter from John Major — there's a three feet high blow up of it in shop window of the games sports shop in cheltenham.
Just in case you missed it, there's a few on the walls inside too.
Why? the shops owner wrote to John Major to ask when the recession would end — the reply from number ten said: The prime minister is very aware of the difficulties faced by many people during the recession — he believes firmly that there are now very real grounds for optimism in the economy.
Shop owner Richard Law doesn't share that view.
He says that it's rubbish — the recession isn't over, and anyone can see this just by looking at the number of failed businesses.
With it's regency architecture and it's floral splendor cheltenham has all the looks of an affluent town: but the signs in the prestigious Imperial square tell a different tale.
This newly built shopping centre has already seen some of it's customers go bust, leaving behind unlet premises.
He says that businesses need Government help: if it doesn't come the Chancellor should resign.
We asked the prime ministers office for a comment — and were passed on to the treasury, which told us that the conditions for economic recovery are very much in place, but people in Cheltenham we spoke to were having none of it.
She says it's geting worse and worse.

This years plum harvest is so good that some trees literally can't take the strain — snapping under the weight of fat, ripening victorias.
You'd think that with such a bountifull crop to look foreward to, the farmers would be cock a hoop.
But no — some are even threatening to let their fruit rot on the trees.
They claim that the huge crop will push down prices, and this, coupled with cheap imported plums from Spain will mean it simply won't be worth picking the fruits.
Paul Dunsby, the chairman of the english plum growers association, says that some farmers will undoubtably lose out:
But fruit wholesaler Peter Ford says there's no way that Spanish plumbs can ever compete with the quality of english plums, even if they are cheaper:
But growers say that people are being conned because some spanish plumbs are being labelled as Victorias — which they're not:
As the row rages on one thing is for sure— shoppers who plump for plums this summer will be spoilt for choice.

It was nine hours before they found Isadore Johnson's body — just fifty yards from his front door.
Accross the road from his home in Northampton, a neighbour found the twenty nine year old London Transport mechanic lying dead in the long grass in her back garden.
She ran to another neighbour for help.
Sue Everson says she came over in tears and could hardly speak but eventually said there was a body in the garden.
Mr Johnson had lived in the street with his girlfriend Gillyanne Anglin-Jarrett for twelve months.
On the night of the murder they were celebrating their engagement with a party.
But not everyone was happy.
Neighbours were being kept awake by the noise.
Belinda White says the noise was terrible.
There was a public address system for the music and her house was vibrating.
Complaints by neighbours led to four visits by the police.
Shortly after their third visit a fight broke out in the street.
The police don't know whether Mr Johnson was involved.
They do know that afterwards no one can recall seeing him.
Det Supt Cross says there was an altercation in the street about 3.30am.
Mr Johnson wasn't reported missing until later.
The murder inquiry based at Mere Way police station now involves sixty officers.
Their first priority to trace everyone at the party — at least forty people some of them gatecrashers.
Mr Johnson's fiancee Gillyanne is helping compile the list — despite her grief.
He says it's tragic.
The party was to celebrate the couple's engagement.
Gillyanne is very shocked.
Tonight detectives admit the motive for the killing is a mystery.
They're unable to explain why the celebration turned to murder.

The fifteen year old victim told police she was assaulted a year ago as she walked along the High Street in Oxford.
A man dragged her into an alleyway, and attacked her in a nearby churchyard.

Detectives are linking all three attacks to the same man.

In June this year, a student was raped after a man followed her into toilets in St. Giles in the city centre.

This is top class rally driving as you'd expect to see it…
British Champion Colin McRae pushing everything to the limits…it requires rapid changes through the gear box…even when cornering…now in the Banbury factory of Prodrive engineers have spent 18 months developing a semi-automatic gear box…they're already becoming common in Formula One…now for the first time they've been successfully introduced in a rally car…with just a touch of a button the driver can change gear without having to take his hand off the steering wheel.
David Lapworth says the new gear box makes the car easier to drive because the driver is able to concentrate on driving rather than worry about gear changes.
Colin McRae says it won't make the car much quicker but it will allow the driver to hang onto the steering wheel for much longer and will require less effort.
This will be especially useful in long rallys, which are physically very demanding.
In last year's RAC rally Colin McRae and co-driver Derek Ringer got off to a flying start in a manual gear box Subaru…leading until they crashed out.
This year they've used the semi-automatic gear box in the Scottish rally, driving it to victory.
Colin McRae says that when the gear box is working properly, it should be better than a manual change because a driver can make mistakes.
It's not detracting from the skills of the driver because in the end everything relies on the driver making it work.
And Prodrive reckon that one day we might all be driving around with semi-automatic gear boxes just like Colin McRae…on second thoughts, perhaps not just like Colin McRae.

Ringing the changes for one of Oxford's best known buildings.
The Great Tower is five hundred years old…to celebrate…past and present members of Magdalen college joined in an anniversary peal.
Aged from eighteen to eighty, some hadn't rung a bell for almost fifty years, but everyone pulled their weight on this historic occasion.
Magdalen Tower is probably the best known symbol of Oxford.
Built of Cotswold stone from quarries at Headington, it was actually finished in 1509.
King Charles the first praised it's beauty.
From the top it provides magnificent views of the city's famous skyline.
And the tower is the centre of attention every May morning when the choir sings out across the rooftops.
For those celebrating it's history, the Great Tower is second to none.
Not everyone could manage the climb to the ringing chamber, but they came to listen anyway.
The tower began with five beels.
It now has ten.
One of the bells is in fact 82 years older than the building.
The bell ringers have made their celebrations heard.
And for centuries to come, they hope the Great Tower will remain one of the great sights and sounds of Oxford.

Why? the shops owner wrote to John Major to ask when the recession would end — the reply from number ten said: The prime minister is very aware of the difficulties faced by many people during the recession — he believes firmly that there are now very real grounds for optimism in the economy.
Shop owner Richard Law doesn't share that view.
He says that it's rubbish — the recession isn't over, and anyone can see this just by looking at the number of failed businesses.

Mr Major was in the city to open new buildings at Oriel College and he also went on an impromtu walkabout, meeting people in the city centre.
Earlier this afternoon I spoke to him about his party's ailing fortunes in the year since the General Election.
JOHN MAJOR MP Prime Minister
We've had to do some very uncomfortable things to put the country on an even keel for the future.
It hasn't been easy for people across the country it hasn't been easy for businesses and it hasn't been easy for the government to do it.
But we have had to do those things.
What we can now see is that for the first timefor a very long epriod we have inflation at a ver low level and the clear prospect of growth without inflationary difficulties.
That is a very considerable prize but it has been painful to achieve and I am unsurprised that it has caused some disruption.
When we talked to party workers at the county council elections there was a feeling that you have lost touch with the grass roots of the party.
Have y ou?
No I don't think I have, indeed I am meeting members of the grass roots of the party this afternoon.
I understand that feeling because we have had to do things that are counter intuitive and very difficult but unless we had driven inflation out of the system we would not have provided a proper platform for secure long term growth.
If I can talk about one particular council, Gloucestsershire, feel they have reason to be aggrieved with the Government.
They have been charge capped and have been forced to make cuts and the Tory group themsleves felt that the Government spending limits were unfair.
Have they had a raw deal?
No I don't think they have.
I mean to be frank I hear this charge from all over the country.
I could hear it in a whole range of other counties as well.
We're actually doing this interview here in Oxford.
In Gloucestershire they have a rather more generous settlement for education than in Oxfordshsire.
Oxford might complain about that.
You can produce a whole range of different ideas to suggest th at one county or antoher is doing badly but the same rules apply to all of them.

Colin Calderwood, the man who skippered the Robins to their Wembley triumph last season, but joined Tottenham Hotspur soon after, has been valued by an independent transfer tribunal at 1 and a quarter million pounds.
About half that money will go to Mansfield Town, under a deal that Swindon's then manager Lou Macari agreed with them when he bought Calderwood 8 years ago.
But Swindon are satisfied with the outcome.
Today's result is in marked contrast to the Glenn Hoddle tribunal last month.
Then Swindon asked for a million pounds, Chelsea offered nothing, and Hoddle was valued at a maximum of 175 thousand pounds.
This time, they asked for 1 and 3 quarter million and Spurs offered 350 thousand, but the final figure was much nearer Swindon's valuation.
Manager John Gorman's already spent half a million on Calderwood's replacement, Adrian Whitbread, but he's delighted to have more money for buying players.
Good news for Gorman, bad news for another former Swindon manager, Spurs boss Ossie Ardiles.

The river Severn — claims Greenpeace — is already badly polluted in places, caused mainly by the cocktail of chemicals and heavy metals discharged into its estuary by factories at Avonmouth.
But some of these substances make their way upstream, says Greenpeace, and mix with pesticides which have leached into the water from farmland, and other chemicals from firms legally allowed to discharge into the sewage system.
The national rivers authority monitors water quality — but says greenpeace, is not doing a thorough enough job:
He says that the NRA does not measure enough of the substances being discharged into rivers.
The NRA says that it's monitoring procedures are thorough.
He says that they sample for dozens of chemicals — the Severn supplies drinking water so they have to be accurate.

As far as Greenpeace is concerned — unless the rot is stopped now rivers like the Severn are doomed to slow death by poisoning.

One gypsy lorry was destroyed by fire.
Two others were wrecked.

They were armed with pick axe handles and staves.

But the police believe the fight started after a large number of gypsies returned from this hotel in Northampton where they'd held a wedding reception.

In the latest raide the man held up two cashiers at the Woolwich Building Society in Aylesbury.
This picture was taken from a security video.
The man, wearing just sunglasses to disguise himself, is reaching into a plastic bag where he claims to have a gun and a grenade.
The police believe he may be responsible for three robberies which took place in the Thames Valley region in one afternoon.
The first raid was at the Woolwich Building Society in Reading just before 12.30 on Monday lunchtime.
An hour later, the second robbery happened at a branch of Barclay's Bank in Oxford and at 3 o'clock that afternoon the Aylesbury robbery took place.
In all more than four thousand pounds was stolen.
In each of the robberies the raider handed over notes demanding cash and claiming he had a gun.
During the raid at Barclays in Oxford, several customers were in the bank at the time.
The police say the man they're looking for is around five feet 10 inches tall and in his late twenties.
They say he may strike again and they're appealing to anyone who recognises this picture to contact their local police station.

They've been making vitamin pills at GR Lane Health Products in Gloucester for sixty years.
With more than thirty products selling to over fifty countries it's a multi million pound business.
But the Consumers Association say products like these are unneccesary and not worth buying.
In a report published today the Association claims that most people can get all the vitamins they need from a healthy diet.
Manufacturers say that's easier said than done.
The report agrees that certain people like pregnant women or those convalescing may need extra vitamins.
But is accuses manufacturers of being misleading.
GR Lane though is confident its customers are all satisfied.
In nineteen ninety we spent fifty two million pounds on vitamin supplements.
It's yet to be seen if the report will have an unpleasnat side effect on sales.

Barnsley is an imposing 17th century manor house, which could all too easily be surrounded by the typically formal, landscaped gardens of the era.But ever since Rosemary Verey began gardening here thirty years ago, she's been determined to make the four acres of grounds a welcoming place.
So nothing at Barnsley House is too grand…and the broader vistas are broken up by judicious planting of trees and shrubs.As for the flower borders…they owe more to the Victorian cottage than to the stately home:
Female speaker
It's important for a garden to be welcoming.

There is formality…such as the Elizabethan knot garden, with its tiny box hedging…and the walk of Lime trees.But such order simply helps to set off the flower borders which overflow with colour.Here can be found a blue and white monkshood…the towering flower spikes of acanthus, commonly known as bears britches…crimson penstemon blooms, and the perennially popular day lily.
Not surprisingly the brilliant pink and red displays of annuals like cosmos attract the artists.
Charles and Susan Neal are locals from near Cirencester:
Male speaker
The garden is like an artist's palette with all the brilliant colours.

Instead his owner, 18-year-old Helen Woodruff from Walcot in Swindon, ignored advice to have him treated, and when the RSPCA found him 6 weeks later the wound was so swollen that Capri was in agony.
Woodruff admitted causing unnecessary suffering when she appeared before Swindon Magistrates.
She was given a conditional discharge but banned from keeping any type of dog for 7 years.
Her former boyfriend David Odey from Penhill pleaded not guilty to the same charge and will be tried at a later date.
Meanwhile, Capri's undergone 2 operations at a vet's in Wroughton.
It's hoped he'll have the bandage removed in 2 to 3 weeks, but it's unlikely that he'll ever recover full use of his injured leg.

Tracy Miles and Susan Little say they're victims of a policy now adopted by many insurance companies.
Because of it they say they've been forced to live in a tent with their young children.
The women, who are twin sisters, were staying in a guest house at Wantage, their rent paid by the social services.
But the owners had to throw them out because they were faced with a huge increase in insurance premiums, up from a $1000 to almost $5000.
Many insurance companies say they won't cover properties where tenants are on housing benefit.

A senior police officer has been criticised for the way he investigated the death of a student.

CLARE LAFFERTY/Stroud
After an eight month investigation, Gloucestershire police came to the conclusion that he'd taken his own life.
But Marc's parents, the Reverend Michael Jeffrey and his wife Ann, refused to accept that.
They made an official complaint about the way Detective Chief Superintendent Colin Eynon and his team investigated the case.
The Police Complaint's Authority now agrees there were errors.
It calls Detective Chief Superintendent Eynon's decision not to treat the death as suspicious’ premature and ill-advised’.
It says officers did not’ pursue and properly explore all avenues of inquiry’
And that Marc's fellow students should have been interviewed in the early stages of the inquiry.
The PCA also says that Mr Eynon’ did not fully undertake his responsibilities’in giving Seargeant Tony Long, the officer investigating the case, adequate support staff.
Sergeant Long will now be disciplined by chief officers.
Mr Eynon retired from the force two months ago and so can't be disciplined.
No one from the Gloucestershire police force was prepared to be interviewed about the matter, but the Deputy Chief Constable, Nigel Burgess told us
’ We accept entirely the findings and recommendations of the report and have already implemented whatever changes are necessary to make sure this doesn't happen again.’

He says that some contained mustard gas, which choked and burnt.
After the war the military organised a big cleanup in the forest — and the ministry of defence says there's no reason to believe that any buried weapons still remain.
He says it would have been impossible to find all the hidden ammo.
But from time to time sinister relics from the past still turn up.
Brian Cave is a member of the council for the protection of rural England.
He says he once found some old ammunition sticking out of the ground.
It was very dangerous.
The Forest of Dean has long been used as a dustbin.
Riddled with dissused mine shafts, caves and quarries, it presented an easy way to dispose of waste.
Between 1963 and 1976 Rank Xerox pumped up to ninety thousand litres per week of liquid sludge into the Fetter Hill quarry near Coleford.
Among that sludge were quantities of the heavy metal Cadmium, known to be highly toxic.
The company says the site has been properly sealed and no outside contamination has been found.
Watkins engineering, at Sling, had a novel way of getting rid of industrial toxic waste — tip it away down an old mine shaft.
It's meant a build up of toxic gasses below ground, and health warnings to cavers who've been exposed to the chemicals.
When Central South first showed you these pictures last february, Watkins said that they were going to empty the shaft.
Six months on, and pot holers are still waiting.
Thousands of dead fish were the result of toxic chemicals being dumped in this brook near Coleford.
This major pollution scare took weeeks to clean up.
A lorry driver has been charged and is expected to appear in court soon.
as if all this is not enough, there's also the problem of fly tipping.
Houshold rubbish and builders waste strewn around some of the most picturesque parts of the forest.
He says that they've had a three man gang picking up peoples rubbish for the last seven years.
But the forest has been spared perhaps the ultimate in toxic waste.
He says in the 1950's there were plans to dump nuclear waste in mineshafts.
It never happened, thankfully.
The Forest of Dean has suffered many abuses in the past.
But it seems there are still those who are determined to pollute one of the areas most beautiful places even today.

In February 1921 Armstrong's wife Katherine died, after a long illness.
She was buried in St Mary's churchyard.
Eight months later Oswald Martin was surprised to be invited for tea at the Major's home.
Afterwards he suffered severe stomach pains.
Martin then remembered some chocolates he'd received anonymously a month earlier.
His sister ate one, and was taken ill.
The local doctor found traces of arsenic in Martin's system.
The chocolates had been laced with arsenic too.
Major Armstrong was arrested on New Year's Eve 1921.
His wife's body was exhumed and found to be riddled with arsenic.
Armstrong was tried for murder at Hereford Assizes.
The case caused a sensation, with crowds outside the court every day.
The defence claimed Mrs Armstrong could have taken the poison herself and committed suicide.
But Armstrong was found Guilty and became the only solicitor to go to the gallows for murder.
In Hay the arguments about his guilt go on:

Arsenic was a common substance and could have been in some of the remedies Mrs Armstrong took.

The chaos happened after workmen resurfaced a mile and a half stretch of the motorway north of junction 16 between Watford Gap and the turn off for the M-45.

This car was stripped out and written off after being stolen from a car park.
It was left for just for half an hour at the Westgate Centre in Oxford, which according to the AA is the one of the worst car parks in South East England for security.
Until the insurance company pays out this mother will have to rely on lifts.
She says she needs the car to get around with to small children.
Now she'll just have to find a car that people don't want to steal.
The AA says it surveyed two hundred and sixteen car parks…and the Westgate Centre scored joint lowest in every category.
Compared to the others it was expensive and dirty, with poor lighting and poor security.
There was no evidence of security cameras, fire extinguishers, or emergency procedures.
But motorists using it today had mixed opinions.
He says he uses it every week and hasn't had any problems.
She says it could be dangerous for a woman, but isn't everywhere in Oxford.
He says he's not happy.
There are too many places for people to hide.
The Barns Road pay and display Car Park in Cowley also came out worst in the survey.
The AA is now calling for immediate improvments.
According to figures from Thames Valley police crime in multi-storey car parks is on on increase.
Vehicle thefts have nearly doubled in two years.
And many more cars have also been broken into and their contents stolen.
But Oxford City Council says the AA has exagerated the risks motorists face in it cars parks.
He says the public are still using the car park in droves.
They aren't listening too closely to the AA.
The city council now plans to introduce more security patrols but the AA is now campaigniung for a change a law…so that car parks can be set minimum safety and security standards.

It's not hard to see why the Folly Fellowship gets Jo Fletcher to make its birthday cakes.
She has any eye for detail and a steady hand to piece it all together.
This is the fourth year running she's been asked by the Fellowship to create a cake in the shape of a folly — this one is of a pair of ornamental greenhouses nicknamed Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
Once the final details made of icing sugar are stuck in in place with water…it's time to put the whole thing together.
sequence/music.
The real thing is in Stancombe Park near Dursley in Gloucestershire, the setting for this year's Folly Fellowship garden party.
This is part of one of the most romantic folly gardens in the country.
Set in a valley, tucked away from the house and formal gardens, a series of temples and tunnels surround a lake.
The story goes that ealy in the last century the then owner, a reverend David Edwards made a good marriage to a rich but stout lady, Miss Purnell.
He went on to have an affair with a gypsy girl.
The son of the present owner takes up the story.’
In fact a more realistic explanation for the laying out of the garden is that at the end of the Napoleonic wars there were alot of unemployed soldiers looking for work.
It's likely they were given work constructing the gardens.
This would explain the Egptian influence, which was popular after Nelson's victories on the Nile.
Wahtever the true story, Folly Fellowship members took full advantage of the chance to spend an afternoon exploring Stancombe Park.
The society has 400 members from all over Britain and some from Europe — though the concensus seems to be that follies are an English speciality.
Back down in the secret gareden there's still plenty to explore, including more tunnels — some of which are not empty…
At the end of one pathway there are two Egptian doorways — one leading to an ice-house.
The Egyptian theme was taken up y the caterers — dressed in costumes designed for last sumnmer's Earl's Court production of’ Aida’.
Besides having a good time at garden parties, Folly Fellowship members have pledged to fight to preserve’ lovely and unloved buildings of little purpose from being destroyed.
There are also members who've gone one better and created new ones in their own gardens:
All are united by their passion for follies — for one man, they've practically become a holy grail…
Thousands of children have been braving the rain and having a good time…just to show how necessary it is…to have a good time.
They've been taking part in Playday '92…a national event emphasising the importance of play.

To the older generation, this might seem like typical rave music.
But to the children of Gloucestershire, it's just making a song and dance about having fun.
If you went down to Pitville Park in Cheltenham today, this was where it was all happening…thousands of children taking part in Playday 92.
She says it's all about giving the children an opportunity to play with things they couldn't normally play with.
Playday is a national event, celebrating the importance of play for children.
There's no doubting what the kids think of it.
Not surprisingly, it's pretty popular with the parents too.
Many of the day's activities took place indoors to escape the heavy rain.
And that wasn't the only dark cloud on the horizon.
Lack of money means this could be the last Playday in Cheltenham.
Now the organisers are hoping to drum up support from local businesses to beat the threat of closure and keep the Playday alive.
Cricket now, and Northamptonshire are on the verge of a place in the NatWest Trophy final at Lords.They bowled out Warwickshire for a hundred and forty nine in the semi final at Edgbaston, and were further helped by some disastrous Warwickshire batting.

Farmers are wondering what to do with eight million tonnes of straw now that burning it has been banned.
But one inventor thinks he has the answer — a building material made of straw that can withstand very high temperatures.
HARRIET RYLEY/Environment Reporter
LITTLE MILTON/Oxfordshire
OXFORD
BRANCO BABIC/Inventor
CHARLES PEERS/Farmer
There's a regular traffic of straw from here to the west country which is mostly pasture-land and needs to order it in from outside the area for animal feed.
But for farmer Charles Peers the amount of straw he can sell is just a fraction of what's left over after each field is harvested.
Since the end of last month it became illegal to burn off the stubble after harvest — that leaves farmers with the options of either ploughing it in or looking for alternative uses for it.
This man thinks he's found one — using excess straw to make a material which can withstand heats of up to two thousand degrees.
It's a mixture of eighty per cent treated straw coated with concrete, called strawcrete.
He says the most obvious way is to use it for fireproof doors — for ceilings, lining internal paritions, all of which require to prevent fire going from one room to another for a given period of time.
Most conventional firedoors are made of compacted chipboard wood.
Regulations stipulate they must be able to withstand heat of up to eight hundred and fifty degrees for at least half an hour.
Mr Babic says strawcrete passes that test…but there could be other problems to overcome.
He says because straw is a bulky material it's expensive to transport — also it's very inflammable and deteriorates once it gets wet so must be stored in big, dry storehouses.
Strawcrete firedoors are unlikely to appear in the near future.
Branco Babic has been trying to find a manufacturer who's interested in the possibilities of strawcrete for the past two years.
So far he's had no luck.
A company which makes silk ties for the Buckingham Palace gift shop is working flat out to keep up with demand.
At first the Palace asked for just a thousand exclusive ties to be made.
But they've proved so popular with visitors, the order has been increased six fold.
CLARE LAFFERTY Beckford
ANNE GARDENER Beckford Silk
The ties are on sale exclusively at the Palace gift shop for twenty pounds a piece.
They're proving very popular.
Three hundred were sold in the first two days.
So Palace officials have now put in another rush order with the Gloucestershire company that makes the ties.
All the ties are made from hand-printed Chinese silk.
The material has to be washed and steamed before it's ready to be sent to the needlework department.
There the ties are cut out and hand sewn.
There are four designs.
The people at Beckford Silk are happy to think that their ties will end up around the necks of tourists from all over the world.
No doubt they'd be even happier to see one adorning a Royal.

The twenty one journalists were dismissed in May nineteen eighty nine for striking in support of a sacked colleague.
There followed three long years of picket lines as the NUJ battled with Pergamon Press chiefs for reinstatement.
But the then owner Robert Maxwell wouldn't budge.
In May last year Maxwell sold Pergamon to a Dutch company called Elsevier, but the dispute continued unabated.
Today though the news that Elsevier have agreed to give the union eighty five thousand pounds for the journalists.
In a statement issued this evening Pergamon Press say:
We confirm a sensible financial settlement has been agreed with the NUJ.
No jobs are involved.
We are pleased that a dispute in which the current management of pergamon Press has played no part has now come to an end.
So despite the payment reinstatement of the sacked journalists is still no nearer but some intend to keep up the pressure to get their jobs back.

The cry for help comes from officers at Long Lartin Prison near Evesham.
They already have the unenviable task of supervising some of the most dangerous prisoners in the country.
Now they claim they're regularly being subjected to violence by inmates — twenty officers have been seriously assaulted so far this year.
One of them had only been at Long Lartin for three weeks…
The final straw for the Prison Officers' Association came when two officers were kicked, beaten and punched in a fracas earlier this week — one went to hospital, the other's on sick leave.
Now the POA wants the Government to take urgent action.
The prison governor is on leave; the deputy governor refused to comment.
But the Home Office told us it was concerned about attacks on prison officers and it will be reviewing staffing levels.
Meanwhile working at Long Lartin remains a depressing business…
It's a problem that shows no sign of disappearing — while we were at Long Lartin there was another skirmish which left two prisoners seriosuly injured.
The POA says previous appeals for extra staff have fallen on deaf ears; if the same happens this time, they fear they'll soon have a riot on their hands.

The fire devastated Station Mill in Banbury last March.
The company, Altovar Limited, makes varnish, which ignited after a worker used a blow torch to try to unblock a pipe.
Today managing director Ian Dury appeared before Banbury magistrates and admitted breaking the Health and Safety at work act.
The court heard that the worker wasn't to blame.
It was common practice in the company to use a blow torch on a pipe.
But this time there'd been an unfortunate accident — the worker had been distracted and had applied the blow torch to a pipe opening just as the varnish was starting to flow.
No one was injured but factory inspectors say there could easily have been casualities.
She says it was an old building and someone could have been stuck on an upper floor.
Today the site of the Mill is derelict.
After the fire Altovar Limited moved back to its old premises.
The court heard the use of blow lamps on blocked pipes has been banned.
And the fire has also pursuaded other companies across Britain to change their procedures.
She says the Health and Safety at Work Act is intended to make companies think in advance about what could go wrong.
The factories inspectorate is confident the lessons of the fire have been learnt.
And Altovar Limited has been given three months to pay the eight thousand pound fine.

I got into the sport when my wife wanted a flight.
We went along to a ballooning club and pestered people to let us have a free flight.
We got one flight and both of us fell in love with the sport.
Since ballooning was invented by the Montgolfier brothers more than two hundred years ago the sport has changed.
Increasingly companies realising the advertising potential of these festivals are moving in.
But behind the logos not much else has altered.
He says the materials on the balloons have changed.
They're made of nylon which is more serviceable.
Now we've got burners, in the Montgolfier days they lit a bonfire underneath it, so we've got a lot more control over it now.

An accountant has poled his way into the record books by becoming one of the most successful punters of all time.
Bruce Maidment has won one of the major Thames races for the ninth successive year.
He says it's all a question of balance.

BRUCE MAIDMENT/Champion Punter
Voice over
Not quite the sort of punt to take on a picnic.
Bruce Maidment's craft is 28 feet long and only two feet wide.
It's built for speed, and at this game no-one's faster than Bruce.
Flat out at 8 knots, he almost breaks the Thames speed limit.
So what's the secret?
He says you need strength but also balance.
The most important thing is to keep the punt going straight.
Competition punting only takes place on the Thames but the sport's devotees take it very seriously.
Bruce has scooped almost every trophy there is.
He's won the Wargrave Regatta nine times in succession — the first to do so in its 126 year history.
This year he completed the course in a record time.
But even he is not immune from the fate which worries every recreational punter.
He says he's fallen in many times.
If a punting pole gets stuck in the mud the best thing is to twist it.
If it doesn't come free you should let go.
At 36 he says he's getting old for this very energetic sport.
But it's a good bet that this punter will be back on the course next year.

Air Force doctors from Wroughton in Wiltshire have been examining those selected for the airlift.
It was immediately clear that the British effort will make little impression on a queue of casualties which grows every day.
Of the 41 people to be flown to Italy, some are being cared for at home and only four are children.
But there are many in hospital who are not on the list but urgently in need of proper treatment.

Bosnian doctors are doing what they can, there is only enough electricity to power the theatres, dressings have to be washed and reused.
Urgent medical supplies were flown out from Lyneham yesterday, but for many victims the only hope of a full recovery requires the full faclities which only countries like Britain can provide.
Tonight the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford said it would take two patients from the airlift.
They're both men of 27 who sustained head injuries some months ago.

People living on the estate couldn't believe their eyes when they saw their new neighbour.
The smaller birds got used to her after a while.
Interview.
He heard the crows making a lot of noise, then he saw the eagle and thought there was something wrong with his glasses.
Thumper's brother Coco was having no problems at his weigh in.
But he's not overweight like his sister who usually shares this aviary.
Her owner claims she probably wants to exercise to shed a few ounces.Pets should be safe as Thumper s not been trained to hunt and she's refused to be tempted down with titbits.
Interview.
He says he's tried guinea pig and dummy rabbit but there's been no response and in answer to question says he hopesto she'll break the diet tonight.
Her owner hopes eventually Thumper will fly down to eat from his hand so he can fasten her onto his training glove.
But they'll only be able to do that when she's hungry and she's lost her appetite for freedom.

We don't get to see them in the states so we have to come over here.
One couple even put off their wedding because of the band…
She says; We waited to get married so we could see Fairport concert on our honeymoon.
He says; It seemed somehow exotic we have already been to the Bahamas and Bermuda and this seemed different.
The festival at Cropredy started as a reunion concert when the band split up…they reformed six years ago and by then the annual event was well established…each year present and past members line up…
He says; The set is almost a recollection of Fairport's career.
On Friday we're playing for a couple of hours with a few suprise guests one had considerably more hair than the rest of the band put together.
I can't tell you anymore but’ his mane remains the same’after all this time.
One band member who won't be playing his normal role this year is fiddler Ric Sanders…he fell through a plate glass window earlier this month.
He says; I am absolutely shattered not to be anle to play.
I hate it.
If I damaged the nerves I would probably never be able to play again.
The twenty fifth anniversary may be special but for some fans whatever they do the band just can't go wrong.

Derry Holmes his wife and six children were on board the Celtic Pride Ferry when it made what was only it's second voyage.
Even in 1987 the brand new ship was suffering smells similar to those which led to the deaths of Katherine and James Tomlins.

The smell was so bad it made some of his children sick:
She says it's the worst smell she's ever encountered on a Ferry.
It made her sick.
Mr Holmes says he reported the matter to the ferry company, and they told him the air conditioning wasn't working.
Meanwhile as the funeral's taken place today of Katherine and James Tomlins in Cork, the owners of the Celtic Pride said that they would be withdrawing the vessel from service next week for modifications to the sewage system.
He says that the problem was caused not by blockages — which are responsible for most smells on ferries, but by a vaccuum — a one off fluke.
Most ships have smells.
He says there are smells, and there are smells: this one was like no other.
Holmes says that there should be no further sailings until the problem is sorted out: No one else should be put at risk.

Severn Trent is being forced to make the changes at the Netheridge Sewage Works near Gloucester at a cost of more than thirty million pounds…a cost that'll be shouldered by the customer.
It's been told to improve the works by the National Rivers Authority which monitors pollution.
Recent studies by the authority have shown that partially treated sewage going into the River Severn from the plant uses up valuable oxygen and is partly to blame for the death of some fish.
Built in the 1950s the Netheridge works provides basic treatment to sewage from homes and industry from a large part of Gloucester.
The NRA says the improvements should bring sewage treatment at the site out of the dark ages.
Severn Trent says it's been aware of the problem, but the money was never available to carry out the upgrading.
Severn Trent has already introduced temporary measures at the site which will help improve the situation.
But the major works will take another four years to complete.
A row of houses that have lain empty for years since being bought by publisher Robert Maxwell look set to remain derelict, after being left out of a plan to redevelop the area.
Critics say the houses should be brought back into use.
Nick Clark reports.

Cllr JOHN POWER Oxford City Council
Voice over
The so-called Maxwell houses line one of the most-used roads into Oxford.
Eight of them stand derelict, as do acres of land around them.
Robert Maxwell bought the houses and some of the adjacent land in nineteen eighty eight.
But because part the site was owned by the Oxford and Swindon Co-op he couldn't develop the area.
The Co-op always had refused to sell to Maxwell, but now they HAVE suddenly agreed to sell to the administrators of his estate who now own the whole site.
That's opened the way for a planning application featuring amongst other things a DIY store and a five hundred and fifty place car park.
But there are no plans for the houses, many fear they'll just remain a boarded-up eyesore instead of providing much-needed accomodation.
Male speaker
We must get these houses back into occupation.

A spokesman for Arthur Anderson, the administrators of Robert Maxwell's estate, tonight said:
’ the whole site is being treated in a way that will give the best possible financial return, that is the duty of the estate's administrators.’
In other words these derelict monuments to Robert Maxwell's empire will remain empty until the most profitable use can be found for them.
In the meantime it's up to the city council to decide whether to accept or reject the planning application.
A decision is expected next week.

JOHN GORMAN/Town Manager
They came back though with a clever free-kick from John Moncur just after the break and then had chances to win it…
But the team they call the Blades were much sharper at finishing and tucked away two late goals to take victory…
Carl Bradshaw made it two-one…and Paul Rodgers three one…
so what did Swindon's new manager make of it all
John Gorman says…they were disappointed with the result but they played well and could have won…the spirit is good in the team and the support from the fans was brilliant
The best Central South scoreline was at the Manor…bags of goals…lots of excitement and plenty to shout about…
United rolled up their sleeves to show the bookies how wrong they are at making them favourites for relegation…
They had a bit of luck against Portsmouth starting with the first goal which spun off Symons but Chrissy Allen and his team mates worked hard and deserved everything they got…
Pompey take some beating…they proved that on saturday by coming back with an equaliser within two minutes a first for their new striker Lee Chapman…
But it was United's new striker Alex Dyer who starred next…he holds the ball up well and what a pass for Allen to chase…some finish to by the young winger…on his day he's a matchwinner…
Portsmouth were back level in two minutes…the United defence in which new signing Anton Rogan played well got caught out by hot shot Chapman again
At the start of the second half Portsmouth looked good for another goal…
Lee Chapman was staring a hat trick in the face…but United's Paul Kee had his eye on the ball too…
Kee and his defence danced with danger more than once…this was a clear scoring chance which Portsmouth missed…
The game was decided on 64 minutes…as far as penalties go you win some you lose some…
United won this one…handball by Chamberlain…the referee and linesman said yes that's what counts and new skipper Jim Magilton slammed in the kick
And United could have scored more they put the Portsmouth goal under a fair bit of pressure…the ball was cleared off the line a couple of times…new boy Rogan nearly finished things off with a fourth but a what a great start to a new season for Brian Horton's men…
In the third division Hereford could have done with some luck…they went down at home…
United though were their own worst enemies…they made enough chances to win but then went and missed them
but things will get better for new centre forward Chris Pike…
this is how to do it Scarborough's goal was well made and taken…great control superb finish by Young…
In the second half United should have pulled the game out of the fire…once again the chances came and went…
two or three should have found the back of the net…
United know the problem let's hope they can find the solution
and Hereford are back in action tomorrow night…they're playing Torquay at home in the Coca Cola cup…while Swindon kick off at the County Ground against Oldham on Wednesday…
It's been the best weekend ever for one Town fan…
David Howell missed the opening game he was playing golf in Scotland where he went and won the British Boys Championship 
DAVID HOWELL/British Champion
At eighteen he's the best in the land…
At the Glenburvie course in Scotland he was up against Europe's top 200 young golfers.
The boy from Broome Manor drove through to the final where he beat the Swedish player Victor Gustafson three and one.
The British Boys Champion Cup has been won in the past by men such as Ronan Rafferty and Jose Maria Olathaval.
So what's it like for young David to be in the big time.
Male speaker
it doesn't feel any different.
He's glad to be back home.
He has a long way to go but will keep playing as an amateur and then try to qualify for the Britsh open…
Voice over
Another winner at the weekend was the Oxfordshire based rider David O'Connor who rode home to take the big prize at the British Open Horse Trials at Gatcombe Park.
The big prize in village cricket will be won by a central south side.
In the semi-finals there were victories for Frocester from Gloucestershire…and Kington from Herefordshire…final is at Lords on Sunday week.
Welcome back: In a few minutes, we'll be dropping in on the pub of the year.
But first, with the sport, here's Tim Russon.

Customs officers are trying to trace the source of drugs worth a hundred and fifty thousand pounds discovered in a consignment of onions.
It appears a smuggling plan went wrong when a lorry driver went on holiday.

Spanish onions bought at a wholesale market in Birmingham were being unloaded at a depot near Evesham in Worcestershire when a worker noticed a cardboard parcel stuffed between the bags.
In the parcel were 100 blocks of cannabis resin, each individually wrapped.
Customs officials have discovered that the onions were driven from Valencia in Spain to Dover and from there to Gateshead, before being driven south, first to Birmingham, then Evesham and discovery.
In the meantime, in a separate incident, a number of people are awaiting sentence after hollowed-out onions were used to smuggle cannabis into Worcester.
That shipment too had come from Spain and had been tracked by Customs.
