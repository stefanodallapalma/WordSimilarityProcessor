ANDREW HAYTON/Speaking yesterday
Andrew Hayton was not in court today.
But after hearing the the judges ruling he surrendeed to police and is tonight on his way back to jail.
Mr Hayton served just six weeks of a three month sentence for killing Sergeant Simon Lilley.
The officer was run down as he tried to wave Haytons motorcycle into a layby on the A5 near Weedon in Northamptonshire.
Haytons conviction for causing death by reckless driving followed a long string of motoring offences.
In a previous accident his wife was killed then a girl pillion rider was injured.
He's also been banned three times for excess alcohol,.
On the night Sgt lilley died he'd been drinking again.
He said he accepted back to prison would cause added distress and punishment, but he said the original sentence did not reflect the gravity of the offence or Haydons bad driving record.
Colleagues of the dead officer say they're pleased with the outcomne of the appeal.
Besides the jail sentence Mr Hayton now faces and eight year driving ban increased from four years.
But before the hearing Mr Hayton who works as a farmer, said critics of the original sentence didn't know the full facts of ther case.

Glyn Smith and his strange looking bicycle are a familiar sight among the busy traffic near his home.
The thousand pound machine he's riding is called a recumbant, it's faster than the usual type of racing bike and has the added advantage of giving it's rider, as the name suggests, a more leisurely riding position.
But Glyn's not just doing this for fun — he want to raise money to help British olympic hopefulls.
He says that there are three local athletes he wants to help — they need contributions towards their expenses.
At the moment Glyn is cycling almost twenty miles a day, getting into practice for his forthcoming sponsored ride.
He's not out to break any records, but says the bike is capable of some very high speeds.
He says that because of the seated position the rider has less wind resistance and more leg power.
There's one other advantage to riding a recumbant — it soothes the parts other bikes always reach.
He says conventional saddles hurt — this is more of a seat so it's much more easy on him.
Glyn sets off on his lands end to John o groats run at the weekend, hoping his pedal power will help give a cash boost to some of Britains olympic athletes.

A Central South MP has become the new deputy Speaker of the House of Commons.
Michael Morris will sit in for Betty Boothroyd…the first woman Speaker, who was elected last week.
But his duties extend far beyond just presiding over debates in the House of Commons, as Simon Mares reports from Westminster.
MICHAEL MORRIS MP/Deputy Speaker
The Leader of the House.
Madam Speaker, I Beg to move that Mr Michael Morris be Chairman of Ways and Means.
With those words from the Leader of the House the Tory MP for Northampton South became the second most important person in the House of Commons behind new Speaker Betty Boothroyd.
Although Mr Morris will spend a lot of time in the chair presiding over debates…with custom dictating that he will no longer vote or speak in the chamber…his new duties go far beyond that.
His official title is chairman of ways and means — that is ways and means of raising money.
The title dates back many centuries to the days when the Speaker was the King's representative in parliament and when MPs wanted to debate raising money they formed themselves into a committee with an MP in the chair so that they could discuss the subject away from the prying ears of the Palace.
Nowadays it means that Mr Morris chairs the House when Chancellor Norman Lamont delivers his budget…and he also presides when the House goes into committee to discuss the detailed budget legislation.
Away from the Chamber he will be a considerable influence in the corridors of power…particularly when it comes to private legislation, that is laws promoted by councils or bodies like British Rail or the Channel Tunnel company.
He decides when these bills, which include the Crossrail Bill on the Chiltern Line, will be debated.
So how will he approach his new role?
Mr Morris has been an MP since 1974 and served his apprenticeship for his new job chairing the standing committees of the House where MPs subject Government bills to detailed scrutiny.
But his new job came as a bit of shock.
Bearing in mind that the new Speaker served as a deputy before being elected to her new post we could be looking at the next Speaker of the House of Commons.

Singapore fell to the Japanese 50 years ago this year, three years into the second world war.
Singapore fell because the Japanese swept through Malaya from the north, an invasion believed impossible by the British.
An intelligence officer in Malaya, Captain Patrick Heenan, has been named this week as the traitor who guided Japanese bombers onto British airfields, allowing a rapid advance and the fall of Singapore.
The news has stunned Heenan's old school, Cheltenham College, in Cheltenham, which is proud of its 14 VCs.
In the college dining room, the world war 2 honours board lists Captain PSV Heenan as a hero who fell in defence of his country.
In fact he was summarily executed.
Sydney Tavender from Cheltenham, is a veteran of the Malaya campaign.
He'd been posted to the Far East in the 1930's and as a police office, he was captured at the fall of Singapore and imprisoned in the Japanese death camps.
He still has his portrait, painted in blood and grass stains by a colleague.
He knew Heenan before the spy was caught.
Cheltenham College has still to decide what to do about Heenan's memorial, but because he was never tried, technically he died an innocent man.

These were the extraordinary scenes in Central Oxford this afternoon as berieved relatives took out their anger on an American airforce colonel.
The families of the nine British soldiers killed by an American missile in the Gulf War wanted to know why the pilots responsible weren't going to give evidence.
The inquest into the deaths is being held at Oxford's county hall because all the bodies were flown back to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.
But today this man, Colonel Robert Bridge, was the only American present, and he's acting soley as an observer for the US Government.
As the inquest broke for lunch one relative cornered him in the street.
He asks him why the pilots aren't coming.
The Colonel says he's sorry.
The relative firing the questions was Peter Atkinson, who lost his son Paul.
Mr Atkinson says he met President Bush just last September, and the President promised him then the full facts would come out.
This afternoon in Oxford, says Mr Atkinson, that promise was broken.
He says all he wants is for the lies to stop.
He says the truth should come out.
She agrees.
The inquest heard claims that American Government has ordered its military not to attend, instead a twenty five page statement about the events of February 26 1991 will be read out in court.
Late this afternnon Colonel Bridge made his position at the inquest clear.
He says he is just an observer, there to see that the American case is put.
The families solicitor believes the Americans have been able to escape cross examination because the inquest is being held in Oxford.
He says if the inquest was in America and not in Oxford then the US airmen would have been left no option but to attend.
The inquest is expected to last up to five days.
But some families are now question whether there's any point if the Americans continue to stay away.
Well as you heard in that report, there's has been strong criticism of the inquest system, which has led to deaths being investigated thouands of miles from where they happened.
The legal profession is divided on the issue.
Some say coroner's courts are antiquated, and unsuitable for this kind of military investigation.
But others say it's the only way to avoid accusations of a whitewash.

The inquest into the so-called friendly fire deaths has turned the spotlight on the Oxford coroner's court…but many believe this should never have happened.
Some legal experts say an inquest is an out of date and inappropriate way of investigating the deaths.
It undoubtedly is antiquated.
The rules covering inquests on deaths abroad were changed following the death of Helen Smith, the British nurse who died in Saudi Arabia after falling from a balcony.
Her father, Ron Smith fought a long campaign for the investigation to be heard in this country.
One of the region's practising coroners says this is the best alternative.
The family wants to know what happened to their beloved.
All coroners hold inquests on people who died aboard, if their deaths would have been inquestable in this country.
The inquests on soldiers who died during the Falklands conflict were investigated by civil coroners courts.
But some have queried whether the coroner, a trained lawyer, is the right person to investigate contentious cases like the friendly fire deaths.
But military experts say the authorites can never get it right.
If it's military the cry is it was rigged.
If its a civil coroners court it's portrayed as a bumbling court.
Families hearing evidence in Oxford hope it does get to the truth.

Cheltenham taxi driver, Richard Morris says he was on cloud 9 when he realised what had happened.
He says he couldn't believe it.
He was shaking.
And so it had.
William Hill calculated the theoretical winnings at over £2 million.
But the bookies have a pay out limit of £500,000.
But even that looks like being a non starter.
All bets are recorded on microfilm at the betting shop, but they say they have no trace of it.

Newcastle reckoned their match against Oxford was going to be one big party.
But it was United who turned out to be the party poopers.
Jim Magilton, who has our vote as man of the match, had the champions at full stretch.
But in the second half, Newcastle were first past the post.
United were too liberal with their marking and Lee Clark laboured the point.
7 minutes later, they took overall control.
Andy Cole's U-turn gave him the space to shoot high into the net.
But then, a late swing in fortunes and Oxford pulled one back.

Across the region, the battle for power is just getting under way; 4 County Councils are now hung.
In Oxfordshire, 8 years without overall control will continue for another 4.
The Tories lost 8 seats, to leave just a whisper between them and Labour.
In a key breakthrough, the Green Party took their first County seat in the region and pledged to make the Green voice heard.
The Tories misery in Oxfordshire was repeated in Wiltshire, where they now have less than half the seats they had yesterday.
It looks like Labour and the Liberal Democrats are set to join forces, adding to the agony for Alan Winmill, who left Labour for the Tories last year.
He says the Government could have helped.
And in Hereford and Worcester the Conservatives saw 12 seats disappear.
There's still no overall control, but it was the Liberal Democrats' night.
And the Lib Dems had the glory in Gloucestershire, almost taking the Council.
They were just 2 seats short.
Buckinghamshire Tories provided the only solace.
Although they lost 10 seats, they're still in control and that's now the only Conservative-controlled County in the country.
Meanwhile Northamptonshire was the region's only Labour breakthrough.
They took 5 seats from the Tories to win control of the hung Council.

He was taken to the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where doctors found he had broken ribs, a damaged spine and minor head injuries.
Mr Gerrish appeared to be making a full recovery.
But eight days later he developed a blood clot and died.
Doctors from the hospital told the coroner that although it was’ highly unusual’for such a thing to occur, such complications did arise from time to time.
But Robert Bell, Mr Gerrish's brother in law, told the court that his family were concerned about the standard of care Andrew had received at the hospital.
They wanted to know why doctors didn't notice a swelling, caused by the blood clot, for two days.
The coroner recorded a verdict of death by misadventure.
The hospital says it has been completely vindicated by the verdict.

Across the region conservatives celebrated local election success…taking thirty one seats from the other parties.
Twelve councils had seats up for grabs…this is how they look now…five are hung councils where no one party has an overall majority.
That's the state of play in Milton Keynes where Labour lost four seats, and control.
The conservatives took two.
We know we've got a job ahead of us…the council is completely hung.
The Labour party have lost their majority which has enabled them to do a lot of stupid things.
Stroud is also a hung council, as is Gloucester where the tories gained three seats…
With such a low turnout the results were unpredictable, but even these results are quite fantastic.
The winner has been apathy and the loser democracy.
We failed quite clearly to get our vote out.
In West Oxfordshire three out of four poll tax rebels lost their seats…they were among eighteen conservatives who resigned the party whip two years ago in protest at the poll tax.
They became independents, and the independent group had an overall majority…but not any more…
The chairman of the council was one of the victims losing his seat to the Liberal Democrats.
Councils are going back to being politically motivated and this is not a good thing.
If you're politcally motivated only you're not your own man, and I think that politics in local government as strong as they're getting now is a bad thing.
I think people wanted a change and that's why they voted for a liberal democrat councillor.
I'm young, and I've got fresh ideas and strong opinions.
Overall, the Liberal democrats lost four seats and gained eight.
Two of those were in Hereford, which they hold.
Chelenham, which last month returned a Liberal democrat MP, remains golden.
It was a bad night for Labour, they lost twenty one seats and failed to win any…but they retained control of Oxford.
Over in Swindon they held Thamesdown despite losing six seats, while a tory win in a Wiltshire by-election means that County Hall is now conservative controlled.

He was in Gloucester to see the only entry to carry the city's name, a yacht sponsored by Nuclear Electric, based in the city.
It's taken him three years to organise the race, and select the crews.
Apart from the champagne spilled over the bow, there was plenty consumed in a more conventional fashion as the crew showed off the new boat for the first time.
Sponsors of each of the ten identical yachts have had to come up with a £220,000 entry fee to get them to the start line in September.
The eight month race will get them home in May next year.

Disappointing; could do better, the end of term report for Swindon will read.
Town had their chances against Barnsley, but their finishing looked somewhat second rate for a first division side pushing for a premier league place.

But Gareth Williams beat him on the second.
The Barnsley keeper, Paul Whitehead had much better luck at his end.

He was keeping a clean sheet against two terrific attempts by Martin Ling and co.
That 1-0 defeat means Swindon finish in 5th place in Division one.
So the County Ground will host Sunday's play off semi final game against Tranmere.
And Swindon head north for the second leg on Wednesday week.
There could be a complete reshuffle of the class of '93 for the play offs. 5 of the side are currently injured, including striker, Dave Mitchell and player manager, Glenn Hoddle.
Others who are out of shape or out of form may be out of the side.
Oxford United ended the season how they began it.
With a win.
Pity they went astray in the middle.
Still, Chris Allen's score was all it needed.
Plus a little help from Oxford keeper Paul Reece who time and time again, denied Watford an equaliser.
It means Oxford finish in 14th place; a million miles away from the relegation zone.
What a difference a game makes.
It was victory for Hereford, but death for Halifax.
Their goal sent the Yorkshire side out of the Football League.
Former Halifax man, Derek Hall was the executioner, who for once was devastated to have claimed the winning goal.

Trade unions at Rover Cars have attacked plans to penalise staff who continually report sick.
A new penalty points system will mean the sack for persistent absentees.

Absenteeism at Rover is currently running at between 5 and 6%.
That's about the national average, but Rover wants to reduce the figure to 3%.
In an effort to achieve that target, it's introducing what it calls an attendance improvement procedure.
Employees accrue points for reporting sick — at first they're just counselled, but ultimately they can be sacked — a system which Rover's two main shop floor unions, the AEEU and TGWU, strongly oppose.
The new rules on sick leave affect employees of all grades, from managers downwards, and all sites — including the Cowley Works in Oxford.
Rover says the idea is to encourage teamwork and save money, and insists that employees with genuine health problems have no need to fear for their jobs.
A spokesman told us:’ The new procedure is designed to ensure that people who are genuinely ill do not face dismissal.’
Employees at Rover's Swindon Works have mixed feelings.

The snail is hermaphrodite…and as long as it enjoys the right warmth and humidity, each individual mates and produces about a hundred eggs which are laid on trays of soil.They hatch a fortnight later.And they're fattened on a cereal diet…either in trays or in polyeurathane tubs.
At the age of fifteen weeks, the snails are fully grown, and ready for the pot.
Surprisingly, there's a big demand in Britain for what's traditionally seen as a French delicacy:
The snails are proving best sellers…especially when cooked with rich sauces and frozen.And while British production is rising to meet demand, in France they're facing a snail shortage.
So in the near future, these Herefordshire born escargot anglaise could be shipped across the Channel to become escargot francais.

But by the end of the fourth race, 5 Cradley riders had fallen.

According to the visitors the track was unfit for competitive speedway.
Oxford's riders were happy to carry on, but referee Graham Brodie said the track was overwatered and the action had to stop.
Nor were the fans happy with the referee's decision.
It's the second time this season that the track has caused a meeting to be abandoned.

One of their riders Paul Muchene died after an accident at an another track 3 years ago.
But former world champion Hans Neilsen says the Oxford track is perfectly safe.
Nevertheless the promoters have already taken action.

Darren Kelly, who's 21, also from Cheltenham, has pleaded not guilty to murdering David Nock at his trial at Bristol Crown Court.
The prosecution say there's no dispute that Kelly killed David Nock, only about whether he intended to kill him.
The weapopn, say the prosecution, was a particularly savage type of knuckle-duster, with an arrow head which protuded from Kelly's clenched fist.
One witness said a security video at a takeaway restaurant which captured two men running down Pitteville Street in Cheltenham, and which was shown on Central South News, prompted her to make a statement to the police.
Andrea McKemsley said she'd been in the takeaway on the night David Nock died.
She'd seen two men fighting in the street and seen them run past her.
The prosecution say David Nock was the first of the running men, he'd already been stabbed and collapsed outside a nearby nightclub calling for help.
He died shortly afterwards in hospital.
The police found bloodstains on the street leading to the nightclub and Kelly was arrested later.
The prosecution say Kelly was the second running man, but the police took a calculated risk.
They released him on bail but he was secretly followed by two police officers.
He was seen to bend down at two drains near his home.
When those drains were searched the police found the knuckleduster knife and the sheath.

MITCH PRYCE/Worcester
If Worcester were to make progress in this competition, the wicket of England captain Graham Gooch had to be claimed — and quickly.
Phil Newport underwent laser eye surgery last winter.
And it was his precision bowling that accounted for Gooch just as he was finding his touch.
It was a blow from which Essex never really recovered — Paul Prichard playing on to Stuart Lampitt.
And then a scintillating piece of fielding from Graeme Hick.
His pick up and throw too good for Salim Malik.
That made it 38 for 3.
Richard Illingworth chipped in with the next wicket — Stephenson trapped leg before sweeping.
Worcester's new West Indian import Kenny Benjamin was then unleashed on Essex.
Nassar Hussein was his first victim.
Knight was the next to fall — straight into the safe hands of Hick, off the bowling of Benjamin.
The final total — 115 all out.
And even the county champions couldn't hope to defend that.
Yes, in fact it was too much for Essex,
Worcestershire made a 117 for 1 off 31 overs, to win by 9 wickets.

It's ordered twenty-one of the new trains, at a cost of £46 m.
The diesel units they'll replace are now 30 years old.
The turbo train will take over stopping services from London to Oxford, Worcester and Hereford.
The future of the Cotswold line from Oxford to Worcester, has been in some doubt following a leaked BR report which revealed that it was to have no further investment, despite its pre-war signalling and rustic stations.
But the Transport Minister, who today tried his hand as driving the new train, said that didn't mean the route was under threat of closure.
Male speaker
It makes no sense to close railway lines except in special services.
We need the Cotswold Line to feed the commuter and tourist traffic to Oxford and Banbury.
Voice over
The new trains were ordered long before the Government drew up its plans to put some routes out to private tender.
With a top speed of 90 mph they're faster than the the old trains and there are many modern refinements.
BR plans more through services to Worcester and Hereford and has forecast a thirty per cent increase in passengers.
But even that wouldn't be enough to put the route into profit.
Whether or not it's eventually privatised, it will still need Government support.
Oxford's Labour MP has welcomed the improved service, but remains concerned about the prospects for the line.
Male speaker
As long as the Government presses on with privatisation there will be a threat to services and a threat of increased fares.
Voice over
The new trains have many safety improvements which will be welcomed without reservation.
In an emergecy the passengers can talk to the driver, who in turn has a radio link to base — a feature recommended in the report which followed the Clapham rail crash.
The first turbo trains will go into service next week.

Julia Verity's life is spent in a never ending legal battle with Lloyds Bank.
She and her accupuncturist partner, Richard Spindler, are now in serious debt, they say, because Lloyds lent them money without proper advice and called in the loan after overcharging them.
It's left them with a 5-year nightmare.

The problem started in 1988 just before the big property slump.
Julia Verity was looking to start a business by buying a house in Henley, doing it up and selling at a profit.
Richard Spindler put up his own house as security.
Lloyds was advertising its services as a small business adviser at the time, but the bank still lent them the money without any business plan and despite a survey report saying it was worth quite a lot less than the loan.
They admit they were naive; that's why they went to the bank.
Female speaker
Yes I was naive.

Mrs Verity's expenditure turned out to be far more than she guessed and their decisions were also affected because the bank was overcharging them for a time.
Eventually, the new house was sold at a loss, Mr Spindler's house was sold to cover the loan and the rest of the debt was transferred to the couple's present house in Henley.
They're currently losing about £70 a day.

Tonight, Everest is being buffetted by 100 mph winds.
The temperature; down to — 35 celsius.
And Oxfordshire's Harry Taylor, here on the left, is relying on a small tent for shelter.
This time last night he walked into camp 4 at 26,000 ft.
He was hours overdue and completely exhausted.
But it made him only the second Briton to conquer Everest without Oxygen equipment.
Today, with another climber, he tried to climb down to Camp 3, but his snow blindness forced them both to turn back.
But his girlfriend, who heard the news at the couple's home in Radley, is confident he will make a full recovery.
She says a woman on an earlier expedition had snow blindness and as soon as she came down to a lower altitude, she was put on a drip and recovered in a few days.
But Harry Taylor is now spending his 4th night at or above 26,000 ft.
Normally a stay of longer than 48 hours at such a high altitude carries a risk of brain damage.
But this Oxford University doctor, who's also a mountaineer, thinks Harry Taylor is an exceptional case.
He says he's shown that he has adapted to a lack of Oxygen.
He should cope a lot better.
The bad weather has also forced Rebecca Stephens to delay her attempt to become the first British woman to climb Everest.
The expedition organisers hope Harry Taylor will be fit enough to come down when the storm passes in 24 hours.

The independent Phoenix Cinema in Oxford is set to play to packed houses over the next few weeks with a film that's bound to be listed among the greatest successes of British Cinema in recent years.
This is Howard's End, the crux of the action and the cause of dramatic change in the lives of the characters.
Although E.M.
Forster's novel states that the house is in Hertfordshire, the house seen in the film is actually near Nettlebed between Oxford and Henley.
Anthony Hopkins plays snooty Henry Wilcox, a man with a past as becomes apparent when he attends his daughter's wedding with his wife, played by Emma Thompson.
Actor, Anthony Hopkins, explains that he jumped at the chance to play a part in the film.
Sam West, son of actors Timothy West and Prunella Scales, who also appears in the film, plays Leonard Bast who tries to improve himself through the arts.
His life is destroyed by the Wilcoxes.
Bast tells Helen Schlegel how difficult it is to get a job in Edwardian England.
Sam and Paul Bradley, who worked behind the scenes, attended a special screening of the film for critics in Oxford.
Sam West explains how he disliked his own performance at first, but now realises it's a special film.
Although most critics approve, a friend of Forster's from University days, does not believe this is what the author wanted.
George Ryland explains that Forster never wanted such a film made, but that he would approve of the filming and acting.
Nevertheless, the Merchant Ivory team, now celebrating a 30 year partnership, are pleased with the film.
It all looks polished, but that was only achieved with some difficulty.
Paul Bradley explains that it was a difficult film to make.
Producer, James Ivory says the books and films are popular with Americans.

There was traffic chaos in and around Oxford after much of the centre was cordoned off.
Office workers and shoppers were evacuated from the area surrounding the Reject Shop in Cornmarket as police moved in with sniffer dogs.
Traffic is now moving more freely although the city centre will be closed for the forseeable future.
Police have released a video of a man who carried out three robberies including one where a shot was fired.

EMI's Greenbridge plant produces more than 100,000 CDs every day.
They cost about 50 pence each to make, but sell for an average of £12.99.
Now a Commons Select Committee says it strongly condemns the pricing policies of the major record companies.
EMI says the report uses emotive and inappropriate language and insists it won't be reviewing prices.
Its local MP sympathises — he says the committee's made a big mistake.

Swindon-based WH Smith is the biggest retailer of CDs in the country.
Smiths claims the record companies are charging so much that it's having to offer large discounts.
In some cases it's even making a loss.
A spokesman said:’ We've been acting unilaterally in cutting prices, with no support whatsoever from the record companies.’
It's now likely that the issue of CD prices will be referred to the Monopolies Commission.
If that too decides prices are too high, the record industry may at last be forced to reduce them.
Education chiefs say they are optimistic they'll get back millions of pounds cut from school budgets by the Government.

500 teachers in Gloucestershire went on strike and sent a delegation to London to back an appeal against a 10 million pound cut in county budgets.
The strike shut 3 schools in Gloucester for the day, after one union voted for industrial action.
All 3 political groups on the county council, supported by hundreds of parents, agreed an education budget above Government limits.
Group leaders, appealing today against Whitehall cuts, are now optimistic they'll get some extra money.
One county MP though believes, if more savings are needed, council staff should be sacked, not teachers.
A final decision from Whitehall on Gloucestershire's spending plans is likely before the end of the month.
Now from Sir David to his brother, Sir Richard Attenborough.
He's directing a new film, Shadowlands, based on the life of C.S. Lewis.

He was joined by two hundred extras for a scene recreating a nineteen fifties version of the city's station.

Sir ANTHONY HOPKINS
There's nothing like a steam railway to evoke the atmosphere needed for a truly British Romantic film set in days gone by.
And many would say Oxford is the perfect place to set it.
But, these days the station looks a bit too modern, so the film-makers chose Platform one at Loughborough.
The Great Central is Britain's only preserved main line railway.
The crew were here to film’ Shadowlands’the life of C.S Lewis, who's remembered at one of Oxford's best-known poets and children's writers.
The director is Sir Richard Attenborough.
He says this the perfect railway to make the film.
Shadowlands is described as a story of epic love.
It deals with Lewis's love affair with an American.
Heading the cast is Oscar-winning star, Sir Anthony Hopkins, best-known recently for his roles in Howard's End and Silence of the Lambs.
He's relishing his new opportunity.
Sir Anthony Hopkins says it's a privilege to play a romantic hero at 55.
The film will cost around £10 million to make.
That includes the cost of turning Loughborough into a replica of Oxford station in 1952.
To make it as realistic as possible, more than 200 extras had to be employed for the two-day shoot.
They included local amateur actors and steam train enthusiasts whose moment of glory will be seen worldwide.
He says they've worked hard to recreate the period.
She says the nearest thing she's done to this was working in a scouts' gang show.
It'll be shown in the United States before the end of the year, but cinema audiences in Britain will have to wait until the spring of 1994 before it comes to our screens.

The food these children get is tasteless and un-nutritous.
Don Powell plans to change all that.
In the shadow of the orphanage, he's helping to grow fresh vegtables which will supply the kitchens.
He was so moved by what he saw inside the orphange that he felt he had to do something to give the children a better start.

Weirs are underwater walls that play a vital role in maintaining river levels by acting as dams.
On the Avon, some of the weirs date back 1,000 years and are in urgent need of restoration.
Two years ago, the Avon Weirs Trust was set up to help raise money for the work.
Its already collected £50,000.
Added to a National Rivers Authority grant of £100,000, it's enabled 3 weirs to be restored.

It's important to restore the weirs otherwise the river would be a trickle and that would affect tourism and wildlife.

The education project is being financed by two charitable trusts.
He says that it's an aid to text books.
Children can get out in the open to see for themselves.
Meanwhile Sir David's exploration continues.
He says that no, the pond isn't just full of green slime and mud, there are thousands of tadpoles, which in themselves are interesting because of the way they metamorphose.

The remarks have outraged the Liberal Democrats, who defeated Mr Taylor in the marginal seat of Cheltenham.

Voice over
It's the political controversy that won't go away…how the Liberal Democrats overturned a sizeable Conservative majority in Cheltenham at last month's general election.
Some put it down to the sheer popularity of the winner Nigel Jones — others to the alleged racism of would-be Tory voters, unwilling to endorse the party's official candidate, the barrister John Taylor.
John Patten — a friend and former colleague of Mr Taylor's — has his own views on the matter.
On election night, after hearing he'd kept his own Oxfordshire seat, he blamed the Cheltenham result on’ wicked old-fashioned racism’and said it was’a slur on the town itself.’
Now he's told the House of Commons that the biggest culprits were the Liberal Democrats themselves.
ACTUALITY
During the campaign Nigel Jones steered clear of the race issue, refusing to be drawn on questions about Mr Taylor's colour.
What Mr Patten objects to is the way that his supporters are supposed to have promoted him as’ the local candidate’…
ACTUALITY
Mr Patten, who was making his maiden speech as Education Secretary, was eventually brought to order by the new Speaker Betty Boothroyd.

Mr Jones declined to comment on John Patten's allegations, but his party colleague Lord Home of Cheltenham, himself a former candidate in the town, says he's outraged…

Last week the police evicted travellers from a field at Enstone.
Today the landowners are still clearing up.
At Enstone Thames Valley police used the powers of the public order act to move the travellers on.
But earlier at Lechlade Gloucestershire police adopted a wait and see policy.
Even though they were camping illegally the travellers were allowed to stay all weekend, before moving off on their own.
Its this apparent inconsistency in police policy which will be discussed tommorow in the House of Lords.
One peer Lord Stanley wants the Government to demand that the police always enforce the public order act.
and check all convoy vehicles for their roadworthiness, effectively taking many off the road.
Not suprisingly travellers view the prospect with dismay.
The irony is even though the travellers have now been evicted from this field in Enstone…it will stay unused…the landowers are being paid to keep it that way as part of the Ministry of Agriculture's Set Aside policy
But even if the rules of set aside were changed to allow travellers to stay one the land…they still may not be welcome.
If the Government listens to tomorrow's debate in the House of Lords, the region so-called new age travellers can a expect a long hot summer of evictions.

This is doctor Ryding, anaesthatist, working in Somalia for the red cross.
And the two lifestyles couldn't be more different.
In the operating theatre of a hospital in Hereford he can get on with his job in the sterile, rather tranquil atmosphere.
But working in war zones there can be some unwelcome interuptions.
He says that he was operating when a bullet wizzed in through the window and hit the surgeon next to him.
So he had to operate on him, on the floor.
These bullets removed from women and children are grim souvenirs of a war in which civilians are often the victims.
Many injuries involve mines.
He says that some mines are picked up by children, they explode when the children play with them, causing terrible injuries.
When there are many casualties, as in the war in Afghanistan, doctors have to make some tough decisions about who to treat first.
He says that there have been occasions when he's had a gun held to his head and been told to operate on someone's brother first, or he'd be shot.
He complied; he says he's not a hero.
So, isn't it rather difficult to adapt to what must seem like some of the trivial aches and pains suffered by his patients in England?
Sometimes it is hard, but you have to realise that relatively speaking, a child's sore throat in England is as important to it's mother as some of the more serious injuries suffered by children in war zones.
Doctor Ryding's passport bears witness to the thousands of miles he's travelled helping to save lives for the red cross.
For now, he's happy to relax in Herefordshire, but soon the phone will ring and he'll be off again to another of the worlds hot spots helping the casualties of war, it's an invitation he'd find hard to refuse.

Parents and teachers have set up one of the first toy libraries in the country for visually handicapped children.
It lets the youngsters use special electronic gadgets which bounce light around.

To four year old Andrew, this a light fantastic.
Fibre optics, which change colour in your hands.
Andrew was born with cerebral palsy, and suffers a form of blindness.
But he can still respond to special toys like this which use light stimulation.
Two year old Joseph lost his sight as a baby.
Working with computer programmes, light stimulation has improved his vision.
For both children modern gadgets like these make a huge difference when it comes to learning about the world around them.
Now teachers and parents have got together to start a toy library for blind and partially sighted children.
The sensory room has been set up at the Ormerod school in Oxford alongside the normal toy room.
Plastic fire engines, brightly coloured musical boxes, even books with sound effects still have their attractions.
But the electronic light and sound equipment can be vital to children who can't get to other toys easily.
Even though they have very little sight, it doesn't stop the children climbing up and touching everything.
Five year old Dick can see the colour changes and feel vibrations from the bubble tube.
Things that light up and make sounds are easier to respond to.
And as the children get older, it makes learning a little more fun.
As experts point out children like Lee and Dick play quite happily with their brothers and sisters who can see.
Playtime is just as important to them.
The Kaleidoscope toy library has been set up with donations.
More equipment, especially computers are desperately needed to help youngsters here have just as much fun as any other children.

Richard Duriez and Annette Tibbles helped to plan a 5-month terror campaign by animal activists.
At Oxford Crown Court, the pair were found guilty of conspiracy to commit arson, following two separate attacks on meat lorries in 1991.
They came during a series of raids by the Animal Liberation Front.
One target was the pig unit at the Cancer Research Institute in Oxford.
Another was the Pig Improvement Company at Kingston Bagpuize.
During the 2-week trial the court heard that damage caused by the group had cost several hundred thousand pounds to repair.
They attacked shops, restaurants, meat transport companies and laboratories, mostly in Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire.
Duriez, who described himself as a pacifist, admitted that he had been to some of the raid locations.
But he said he was researching a television documentary on animal cruelty and was not a member of the ALF.
Tibbles also denied any part in the attacks.
But after almost 9 hours, the jury returned unanimous verdicts on both defendants.
Judge Richard May ordered both to be held in custody for reports.
But he told them:’ These are serious offences.
There must be custodial sentences to reflect that and they will be substantial.’
As Tibbles left the court, she shouted insults at the police.
The pair will be sentenced next month.

The toy section in this Oxfam shop in Oxford used to be a honeypot for children, but there's not much to choose from in it now.
For the last year, charity shops have had to cut back the number of toys they sell drastically because of new legislation.
In January 1989, the Government decided to implement an EC directive, forcing all new toys to bear the European’ CE’safety mark.
What upset charities is that when it was made law here, the Department of Trade and Industry decided to make the ruling stricter and to include second-hand toys.
Because the charities couldn't afford to carry out independent safety checks, they were forced to stop selling most toys.
He says it's meant the loss of half a million pounds income for Oxfam and they're continuing to lose £10,000 a week.
Nationally, charities have lost £10 million income.
Both they and the Labour party are calling for an immediate change in the law to allow them to sell second-hand toys as before.
He says charity shops should be allowed to sell second hand toys as they've always done and the legislation which took them off the shelves was wrongly framed and should be scrapped.
The DTI refuses to ackowledge that it misinterpreted the EC directive saying:
It's the Government's view that since toy safetly legislation was introduced in 1967, buyers of second hand toys should be able to expect the same level of safety as those buying new toys.
Baroness Denton, the Minister for Consumer Affairs, has been in consultation with the charities and an announcement is expected shortly.
Until there is a change in the law, charity shops will continue to lose thousands of pounds of income a week because they can't sell most of the toys donated to them.

And the man who made his money out of glass lenses invited the finest craftsmen in Britain to design and make up a series of stained glass windows.

That was the biggest planned overspend by any council in the country.
This afternoon that put them on environment minister Michael Howard's hit list.
Also there Cheltenham and Gloucester city councils.
The capping means Gloucestershire will have to slash ten million off its budget, resulting in a twenty five pound per person reduction in poll tax bills around the county.
There'll be further reductions in Gloucester and Cheltenham.
But according to some it simply MEANS services like education will be severely squeezed.
In the Tory camp the view is Gloucestershire CAN still maintain its level of service.

The patches seem to be more effective than other aids.
There is no evidence that nicotine chewing gum is any help at all.
But at £2 each, they are expensive and last year the Department of Health ordered GPs not to prescribe them on the NHS.
The doctors believe that ruling should now be changed.
They say giving someone a patch is far cheaper than treating the same person for heart disease or lung cancer.

The Government has said it wants to cut the number of smokers from 30 to 20% of the population by the year 2,000.

Doctors forecast that only half the people who stopped smoking will still be off cigarettes in a year.
But even that would be a success.
Research has shown that each year, only one smoker in 100 is able to kick the habit without some kind of help.
More than a hundred children who survived the Chernobyl nuclear disaster seven years ago have been experiencing life in rural England.
For some, the visit is a welcome break from medical treatment they're receiving for radiation sickness.

JOHN WESTBROOK/INCARE
Children from all over the world delight in contact with animals, but for these youngsters this farm visit is particularly special.
The group, aged between 6 and 15, comes from Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine.
Just 7 years ago, their lives were devastated when a fire at a nuclear reactor in Chernobyl contaminated their homes with nuclear radiation.
Many were orphaned by the disaster, others still suffer radiation sickness.
Male speaker
The children have related illnesses because of a lack of fresh food and vitimins and the economic problems of the region which means they don't see life in the same way as in England.
Voice over
For the children its the trip of a lifetime.
And they've acquired some surprising opinions about Britain.

I like the countryside and people are so polite over here.

A terrier man drives his quad bike into a protestor, knocking him to the ground.
The hunt steward holding the protester even appears to deliberately push him into the path of the vehicle.
Tony Humphries from Northampton needed hospital treatment for cuts and bruises.
He says he was injured, but his treatment means he shouldn't suffer for too long.
Today at Bicester magistrates court, Michael Smith, the vehicle driver and Richard Cheshire, a Hunt Marshall, admitted assault.
Their solicitor told the court they only wanted to frighten the saboteur and they were sorry he'd been injured.
But the magistrates chairman said the offence was so serious, they may have to send both men to jail.
The saboteurs claim supporters of the Bicester Hunt often turn the on protestors.
They've detailed their claims in a report on hunt violence.
He says this is just one of many similar incidents.
He denies they are violent as well.

Hello there.
Welcome to the first of our summer sporting specials.
Over the next 12 or 13 weeks we'll be out and about.
Plenty of action.
We've got white water rafting, canoeing, climbing, mountain racing, all the excitement.
The first one coming up in a moment is the London to Sydney car marathon, we're going on the roads of India and Australia.
But of course the football season hasn't ended yet.
The play offs to the premier league are about to kick off.
So with news of those, here's Erika Barnes.
Swindon Manager Glenn Hoddle may well be thinking who he can count on for Town's play off match against Tranmere on Sunday.
Blighted by injuries.
Paul Bodin is responding well to treatment and should be fit.
Steve White is still doubtful.
Dave Mitchell is running about and is in with a shout.
But the boss himself is most likely to be out.
The last encounter with Tranmere was a bruising affair.
Swindon were hurt most.
After scoring first through Dave Mitchell, Tranmere's Kenny Irons pulled off a hat trick and Swindon were sunk.
But this is no league game.
This is cup tie football.
Anything can happen on the road to Wembley.
And as Swindon found to their cost, it's what happens after that matters.
Male speaker
We're not so much looking to Wembley.
Everyone's after the prize at the end.
Female speaker
Can you remember last time round, when it was snatched away from you?
Male speaker
The elation was so good.
But it was desolate when we were told it wasn't going to be.
It was that empty feeling.
It won't be replaced until we get back to the premier league.
Voice over
Glenn Hoddle has thought long and hard about how to get them there.
Forget about the final he says.
Let's take one step at a time.
Male speaker
You can't deal with Wembley.
We're putting all our resources into getting the first leg over.
But of course it's only half time.
Voice over
Glenn Hoddle's got his heart and mind set on promotion.
Forget talk about possible moves to Tottenham, following Terry Venables' departure.
He's got plenty enough on his plate at Swindon for now.
You can see Swindon's first leg game against Tranmere live on Central on Sunday at 2.45 p.m.
Now for the rest of the sporting headlines.
Over at the Manor, the hallowed turf is undergoing a £100,000 facelift.
The aim is to improve the drainage system.
From now on, there'll be no more playing in puddles at Oxford United.
Gloucester have appointed a new Director of Rugby.
The aim, to keep them at the top of the sport.
They've taken on Barrie Corless, former Moseley and England Centre, who's been the inspiration behind Northampton's recent revival.
He'll be taking charge of coaching, recruitment and welfare of the players.
The Prodrive motor sport team in Banbury has taken on one of its most testing projects yet.
It's preparing and packing up two complete racing operations and sending them to competitions in Indonesia and New Zealand.
These purpose built containers are a mobile home, garage and workshop in one.
They'll carry absolutely everything from cars to snake bite vaccine.
Banbury West End Tennis club begin their campaign in the Everest National League this weekend.
They've enlisted a number of world ranked players to their mens and ladies squads and are looking like favourites to win the premier league title.
And Oxford take on Cambridge in the 119th Varsity Athletics match.
It all takes place at the Iffley Road track.
And so to the first of our summer sporting specials.
The London to Sydney Car Marathon.
It was nearly four weeks ago that we set from Chelsea on the way to Australia.
12,500 miles.
Over the last 7 days, we've been through India.
We're now trekking towards Sydney and the finish at the Opera House.
Tonight we're in the town of Kalgoorlie. 100 years ago, they had a gold rush here.
In a few minutes they'll have a car rush, as 90 cars race through the streets.
So let's catch up with all the action as we go spinning the globe.
Taking the 90 odd old cars to India has been the beauty and the beast of the London to Sydney Marathon.
A night at the Marharaja's Palace at Jodhpur was unforgetable.
The Palace is one of India's Jewels; the Maharaja one of the country's richest men, his own vintage car collection was on show.

But nothing as high speed as racing through the streets of Kalgoorlie.
This is the gold mining centre of Australia.
For one night, it's turned into a racetrack.

But still leading is the Banbury Porsche team of Tuthill and Showell.

Thorn EMI employes 230 people at its CD pressing plant at Greenbridge in Swindon.
It's a highly successful business.
The plant produces 100,000 CDs every day, selling for an average of £13 each.
But now EMI has been accused of exploiting its workforce — in particular, by deliberately sacking casual staff before they've worked there for two years, thereby depriving them of statutory redundancy pay and other employment rights.
Trade unionists say that if the allegations are true, it's an alarming situation.
MPs, too, have expressed their concern — Greville Janner chairs the Commons Select Committee on Employment.
When we asked EMI Compact Disc about allegations that it's deliberately laying off employees before they're entitled to redundancy pay, the company declined to comment.
Casual staff we spoke to said they were aware of the allegations, but considered them unfounded.
These are testing times for EMI.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission announced last week that it's about to investigate claims that CDs are overpriced.
If MPs have their way, these latest allegations could mean that the company soon has a second public inquiry on its hands.

The playgroup can't have an extra day because the chapel might be needed for funerals, according to church elders based at nearby Dursley.
They've made their views known to the pastor, who's also chairman of the playgroup.
The playschool difference of opinion is now likely to be referred to the church's area governing body.

And the game produced excitement worthy of an FA cup final right from the start.
3 goals in 3 minutes — only two of them counted — the first for Swindon, courtesy of an over generous Steve Vickers of Tranmere.
That's another fine mess they've got themselves into.
Just 47 seconds later, it was in the back of the net again.
A fumble from the Tranmere goalkeeper and a thump in from Swindon's Dave Mitchell.
No time to catch your breath.
John Alridge immediately retaliated for Tranmere.
But a push on Hoddle denied him the goal.
Tranmere hadn't learned their lesson.
They let down their defensive guard and allowed Maskell and Mitchell to do their double act for goal number 3.
In the second half, Swindon should have sewn it up.
Mitchell's header hit the cross bar.
If only…!!
Then Tranmere began their rain dance and the revival began.
A few neat steps, a well-choreographed move and they claimed one back.

People living near the site of a new age festival held over the weekend say that all their worst fears about the event came true.
Thousands of travellers turned up, and although police say the weekend went well, there were complaints of noise, drug abuse and a lack of police presence.

The party's over.
Thousands of new age travellers slip and slide their way home through the mud.
The Fayre, at Hillersland near Coleford, took place after a last minute legal battle to overturn a music licence ban.
It's been judged a success by its organisers and a disaster by some of its neighbours.
She says that there was noise, trespass and congestion.
The police have also come in for critisism — for not providing enough officers.
She says that she's disappointed the police didn't turn out in strength.
He says that the venue is huge.
It would have been impossible to circle it with police.
The Fayre's organisers admit there were problems with noise, but say this came from a group of ravers who shouldn't have been there.
He says that a group of ravers from Bristol caused trouble.
There are plans for an event at the site next year, but organisers say it will take a different form.
Those who live nearby say they'll do everything in their power to try to stop it.
Good evening.

Twelve year old Emma Butler died during a kickabout after a five a side football match…she'd been watching her younger brother, Matthew, play in a tournament organised by the St Edmunds Football Club at the European School in Abingdon…details of what exactly happened are still sketchy…but it's believed a hockey goal post which was leaning against a hut fell down crushing Emmas chest…
Spectators and Ambulance crews tried to revive her but she was dead by the time she reached hospital…
Teachers at Emma's school described her as a’ little dynamo’a talented athlete.

It was hoped that she would go onto to be an international class athlete.
She had run for the county particularly in cross country events.
She had a delightful personality lots of friuends who are stunned by the news.

Heavy lorries trying to avoid higher tolls on the Severn Bridge are causing severe traffic problems on minor roads.
Several towns and villages have reported increased congestion, and now road engineers are worried about the impact of the extra traffic.

Toll charges for lorries using the Severn Bridge went up by more than 100% 3 weeks ago and road experts believe traffic in Gloucestershire may have gone up by as much as a third as drivers look for a detour.
Towns like Lydney on the west bank of the River Severn, are reporting increased congestion and now road engineers are conducting a new traffic survey in the county.
On the M4 at Swindon, lorry drivers heading for Wales decide whether to use the Severn Bridge at a cost of £8.40 return, or divert through Gloucestershire.
They all agree the new tolls are too high.
One county councillor, and a former Mayor of Lydney, wants a new river crossing down stream from Gloucester to take traffic away from towns and villages.
Because traffic counts are taken over a one year period, it'll be 1993 before Gloucestershire's new traffic figures are available.

Issued to all Gulf war airmen…
The chemical suit, drug-filled syringes and anti-nerve gas tablets were in a rucksack stolen from an airman's garage near the Brize Norton airbase.
Included is a self injection combipen.
If misused, it could be dangerous.
Male speaker
certainly if taken in high dosage by injecting 2 or 3 combipens or too many of the tablets, it could cause irregular heart beat.
Anyone finding this equipment should hand it in to police.

The incident's being regarded as an opportunist theft and it's unlikely anything taken would be of any use to a drug abuser.
The airmen who they belonged to, is believed to have been away when the things were taken.
Officials say the theft isn't surprising, considering the amount of similar equipment issued for the Gulf campaign.

A firm which produces smoked fish has been hit by fire.

The Coln Valley Smokery was well alight by the time firemen arrived.
3 of the 4 smoking kilns were completely destroyed and the roof of the 300 year old listed building burnt through to it's rafters.
But by this morning, builders had already started repair work.
He says that the fire has ruined three smoke kilns, but there's one left working.
The Coln Valley Smokery uses traditional methods to smoke fish such as salmon, trout and eels.
It supplies stores like Harrods and Selfridges as well as having a big export market.
But the fire won't mean the firm having to close.
He says they've got enough stock in storage to see them through.
The cause of the fire is not thought to be suspicious.
He says that when burning oak powder it's possible that a spark could have gone astray.
Staff are hoping that the firm will be back to full production within 6 weeks.
No doubt about the sporting achievement of the weekend…

5 races, 5 wins, for 5-star Nigel Mansell.
It's almost embarrassing the way his Oxfordshire-based team have dominated Formula One this season.
Same story at Imola; Mansell dominated from pole position and never lost the lead, finishing nearly 10 seconds ahead of Williams team-mate, Riccardo Patrese.
Mansell, who's got his season off to a better start than anyone in history, described it as the happiest day of his life, but was first to acknowledge all the hard graft back in Didcot that made it possible.
Other successes for Central South teams; Martin Brundle coming home in 4th for Benetton, Mauricio Gugelmin in 7th; that's Jordan's best result of the year.
Not a bad day either for Martin Dugard from the Oxford Cheetahs speedway team.
Dugard finished first equal in the British Final of the World Championship at
Coventry, only to be narrowly beaten in a run-off with Gary Havelock.
No luck for Dean Barker, then — like Dugard, beaten in a run-off.
He doesn't make the Commonwealth Final.

The kingfisher.
Once they were a familiar sight along our riverbanks, now thanks to a combination of pollution and the destruction of their nesting sites their numbers have dwindled.
But at Slimbridge Wildfowl Trust, they've decided to create a Kingfisher paradise.
Volunteers at the centre have been videoing this pair of kingfishers and so far it looks as though the experiment is a success.
So how do you go about persuading the birds to set up home?
He says that the kingfishers need a steep bank to nest in, running water, plenty of fish.
They created this environment and the kingfishers loved it.
The Kingfishers are attracting birdwatchers from all over the region.
She says that she usually watches them on the River Thames, she's travelled to Gloucestershire because she's never seen them nesting before.
Staff at slimbridge were delighted when the birds decided to nest.
He says that at first the male bird inspected the hole, then the pair started excavating.
It's hard work building a nest, but theres still time to stop and share a tit bit.
Now it's hoped it won't be long before the baby kingfishers are also on show.

Health experts are campaigning to get more mothers to breastfeed their babies.
They say nine out of ten women have problems in learning to feed, and many give up in the first weeks.
But with better support from friends and professionals, both mother and child can end up healthier and happier.

For the baby it's often the best start in life; for the mum, the best she can give to her child.
Breastfeeding seems completely natural, but 9 out of 10 women who try it, come across problems and many give up.
Experts say with the right help, the problems are easy to overcome; both mother and child benefit.
Lisa says it is a matter of gaining confidence with breastfeeding.
While the debate on bottle feeding versus breastfeeding continues, health experts say those who want to breastfeed should be encouraged.
In National Breastfeeding week, with the help of organisations like the National Childbirth Trust, they're promoting the advantages.
Providing the exact nutrients; protecting against infection and allergies; cheap and convenient; helps women lose weight after the birth and it's also a factor in reducing chances of cot death.
But even the professionals need more information.
Chloe Fisher is a world expert on infant feeding.
Her clinic at the John Radcliffe hospital has a constant stream of parents wanting help.
Through almost 40 years of experience, she's seen women lose the confidence and the art of giving their babies nature's own food.
The Health expert, Chloe Fisher, says it is a baby's right to be given the right to breastfeeding.
Clare Wildish has come back for help feeding her second baby, 3 day old Emma.
She breastfed her first child for more than a year.
Like many others, the problem was mostly the way she held the baby.
Having persevered, she's delighted with the success.
This mother says having extra help was an excellent idea in teaching her how to breastfeed.
But even if they do persevere, most mums find it difficult to feed their babies in public.
Until more people accept it and shops and restaurants provide proper facilities, bottle feeding is by far the easier option.
Mixed views on facilities available for babyfeeding and the social stigma some attach.
Health visitors are joining the campaign to raise awareness.
If more women breastfed they say, it would give others the encouragement to go ahead, both inside and outside the home.
Health visitor, Fiona, says more need to be aware of the support needed from the community for mothers.
But experts like Chloe Fisher, argue that if mums overcame the so called teething problems, they'd have more confidence to breastfeed whenever and wherever they wanted.
Chloe explains it takes a few days to learn how to breastfeed.
For others, bottle feeding still has it's place.
But many say breast is best and you can't beat the satisfaction and the joy.
