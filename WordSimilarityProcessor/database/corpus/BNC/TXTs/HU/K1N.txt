Oxford's women footballers have failed in their bid to win the league and cup double.
They're already Southern champions and are almost certain to be promoted to the National League next season.
But whilst they lost the League cup final at the weekend…they won plenty of friends with their sporting play.

Elizabeth Lamplugh went to court prepared to give evidence against her attacker.
But she was spared from that ordeal when Anthony Bourgois pleaded guilty to charges of false imprisonment and carrying a knife.
A third charge of attempted kidnap was dropped.
The court was told how the 20-year-old French Air force deserter approached Miss Lamplugh as she arrived back at her home in Oxford.
In his possession were three knives.
One had strange inscription, an anagram of the words evil power.
He also had bl; ack leather gloves, masking tape and a length of cord.
Seven years ago her sister Susie, was abducxted by a man who made an appoitnemnt with her London estate agency.
The mysterious Mr Kipper has never been traced and Susie is presumed dead.
After the hearing Elizabeth Lamplugh told of her own ordeal.
She said she'd been terrified but somehow managed to keep calm.
She said she tried to keep her attacker talking and not to be aggressive.
The judge asked for more psychiatric reports on Borgois before passing sentence.
In the meantime he'll be held at Fairmile secure hospital at Wallingford.

When the Conservative grip on power in Wiltshire was broken by a re-organisation of boundaries at the local elections, the new hung council was ripe for a pre-emptive strike by the anti-hunt lobby.
A Labour motion if approved with the support of the Liberal Democrats would ban hunting on all 10,000 acres of council owned land.

It only one took blow to the heart from this knife, worn as a knuckle duster, to kill David Knock.
He quickly collapsed from loss of blood near a Cheltenham nightclub and died later in hospital.
An apprentice mechanic from Cheltenham he was only sixteen years old.
But while jogging home from a disco last year he'd got involved in a augument with twenty year old Darren Kelly.
The chase which followed was captured on a takeway restuarant's security video, this was to form part of the prosecution evidence.
At Bristol Crown Court Kelly claimed he'd forgotten the knife was still in his hand and had only meant to punch.
The jury didn't believe him.
As the jury foreman delivered the guilty verdit, Kelly, standing in the dock and flanked by three prison officers, showed no emotion.
But sitting behind him in the public gallery, some of the Nock family started to cry.
Kelly's lawyer then told the judge that his client had written a letter of apology to the Nocks but on his solicitor's advice it had never been sent.
After the verdict the Nock family couldn't hide their sorrow and anger.
He says he was just starting out in life and they're very bitter that he was killed by one person's obsession for an obscene knife.
This afternoon police had a warning for other youngsters who carry similar weapons.
He says they have formed the notion that it is legal, he is telling them that it is not.
It's one of the most evil weapons that he's seen and could only kill or seriously injure.
Darren Kelly's family left without comment.
The judge said there was only sentence he could pass for murder, Kelly would go prison for life.

Morland has been brewing beers in Oxfordshire since 1711, making it the second oldest brewery in the country.

If successful, Greene King plans to close Morland's Abingdon brewery.
And the future of it's beers like Old Speckled Hen and Morland's Original would be reviewed.
Morland says it'll fight the bid.
Greene King already owns 28% of Morland and has been promised a further 14.9%.
That means, it only needs another 8% to gain overall control.

The bid comes after a change in the law, which was supposed to protect small breweries like Morland.
But instead, it meant that Morland's largest shareholder, Whitbred, had to sell its shares.
The Campaign for Real Ale is backing Morland's fight.
And drinkers, on the whole, agreed.
Shareholders have three weeks to decide whether to accept or reject the offer.
If the bid is accepted, it would mean an end to brewing in Abingdon by the beginning of next year.
The battle of words in a takeover bid for an engineering firm is hotting up — with shareholders being asked not to sell out to a cheap offer.

Dowty's message to shareholders is being spelt out in a glossy brochure, the company's answer to a hostile takeover bid from the Abingdon-based engineering firm TI.
Dowty says that after a rocky patch during the recession, when the company was forced to axe 1,800 jobs, it's fortunes are picking up; not the time to be selling out.
He says that the company is just starting to do well.
The shareholders have the right to benefit from this.
When TI announced its hostile bid, the company claimed it would be good news for Dowty shareholders.
He says that if TI took over Dowty, it would concentrate on building up it's core businesses.
So what do the financial analysists make of it all?
He says that the bid is hostile because it goes over the heads of the directors.
A white knight could come along and make a more friendly offer, but this hasn't happened yet.
2 Dowty executives say they were offered well paid jobs on the board of TI, but turned them down.
TI have accused Dowty of pinching some of it's strategy ideas.
To the layman it's getting nasty, but to the city it's all pretty tame stuff.
He says that he expected more mud slinging; Dowty has been very gentlemanly so far.
In a statement tonight, TI says it considers Dowty's response to it's offer lacks substance, evades the real issues and is confused.
Dowty's 17,000 shareholders will have the final say on 1st June.

The Sapphire could prove to be not only a big hit with disabled people, but also a major success for the Coventry company which manufactures it, as ordinary wheelchairs become a thing of the past.

Hidden away under cover in south Oxfordshire there's a secret rose garden being grown by a man with a mission.
If Mark Mattock can help it, all these roses will be at their best in time for the start of the Chelsea Flower Show next week.
That means keeping them out of the unpredictable British May weather.
Mattocks Roses go back 4 generations to 1875 when Mark's great grand-father, John Mattock set up in business in Headington in Oxford.
Over a century later, the Mattocks are preparing over 100 kinds of roses to take to Chelsea.
There are 5 new names this year; Ice Cream, Mary Pope, named after the founder president of the National Association of Flower Arranging Societies, two of Mattock's county series, Wiltshire and Berkshire and a rose the Mattocks are calling Patio Rose, though that name may change.
The naming of a rose can be yours for a price.
He says it can be very expensive.
It can cost anything between £10,000 and £30,000.
Some people buy very expensive presents for their relations, dear ones.
You can buy a rose and have it named for yourself, your wife or husband.
It will cost you a penny.
Having this rose named Benson and Hedges cost that company a 5-figure sum, though some none-smoking gardeners are put off it by its name.
But whatever a rose's name, its breeding is a well kept secret.
Like all rose growers, Mark Mattocks won't be drawn on the parentage of his flowers.
The Queen Mother is of course impeccably bred, though she's failed to make it to the last 3 Chelsea Flower Shows and looks as if she'll remain at home again this year.
There's more anxious watching and waiting in the run-up to Chelsea going on behind the quiet facade of this house in the village of Wingrave in Buckinghamshire.
Norman Brackley's family have been growing Sweetpeas for 4 generations.
He grew his first ones as a young child in 1936 and modestly claims he's only just beginning to get the hang of it now.
Like the rose, the sweetpea has become part of the tradition of a an English country garden and more sweetpea seeds are sold than any other flower.
The Brackley blooms are brought out early with a little help from 400 watt lamps sunning them from January onwards.
They need 14 hours of light a day to bring out the flowers.
It's Norman's 13th year at Chelsea, but the thrill of showing at the country's premier flower show still hasn't worn off.
He says well…
I suppose we say it's a nightmare — it gets a little bit electrifying to me because Chelsea is the accolade of the world and everyone's expecting their best at Chelsea and which we attempt to do every year.
Every year a Brackley sweetpea is named after a personality.
Last year's was Nanette Newman and past years' include this one named after Elaine Paige; she was hybridised in 1979.
This year's new flower is still under wraps.
Over the road, Sylvia Brackley and daughter, Karen are hard at work on this year's crop.
The plants are trained up a string which is zig-zagged up and down to train it in one place.
Norman is busy trying to get to get to grips with all the paperwork; security at Chelsea is tight and all the family have to have different passes for each day.
They're the only sweetpea growers in the country asked to show at Chelsea; the high standard of their flowers reflected in the 3 gold medals they've won at past shows.
Their chance of another at this year's are looking good.
Tonight's the night when Swindon Town SHOULD book their place to Wembley, for the first division play off final.

The accused man is 45 year old Gary Richman from Swindon.
He used to run a flower shop called Europlants Limited, at Hinders Yard, off Ermine Street.
The Prosecution at Winchester Crown Court alleges that in January last year Richman tried to smuggle 246 kilograms of cannabis resin into Britain.
The lorry it was hidden in had come from Holland, but was stopped by customs officers at Sheerness Docks in Kent.

This latest recruit to the world-renowned Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art has less than usual qualifications.
He has just two O-Levels; one of them a B grade in Art — it would have been an A, he says, if he'd spent a little less time throwing paper at his classmates.
But Mark's first ever oil painting — this copy of David's Napoleon — was enough to convince professors at Oxford that Mark has real talent.
Now he's been accepted, Mark's biggest problem is money.
So he's putting his talent on the market.
His first painting goes up for auction on Friday.
Back in the repair room, Mark's colleagues are proud of his achievement.
Mark, too, is confident he can cope, though he can hardly remember the last essay he wrote.

It's a Category B prison but prisoners are allowed out under supervision.
In the early hours of May the fourth Hanger disappeared from a community training camp at Symonds Yat on the Gloucesterhsire/herofrodshire border.
Police then followed his trail to Dorchester in Dorset.
He then moved onto mid Wales, robbing a publican at gunpoint at Builth Wells.
And just yesterday he was spotted in in the Northampton area.
The publican he robbed in Wales says he's a dangerous fugitive:
He says he tied then up and stole everything he could.
This afternoon a man caliming to be Hanger called Grendon prison and said he was in Aylesbury and armed with a shotgun.
Plain clothes officers immediately began a search of the railway station.
And officers — some armed — were put on guard at Aylesbury police station.
He says Hanger had said he wanted to shoot a policeman and he wasn't going to take risks with his men.

Malvern Girls' College in Worcestershire has forwarded the names of 6 parents to a debt collection agency because they haven't paid fees averaging £3,000.
The money, which should have been paid in advance, is owed for the final term of 6 girls who've since left the college.
The college takes 500 pupils from across the world and decided to call in debt collectors as a last resort.
Parents believe the recession may be having an effect on some people's ability to pay the £10,000 a year fees, but the college needs the money.
The Independent Schools Information Service, which advises parents about private education, believes there's a distinction between parents who can't pay and those who won't pay.
Most private schools are thought to have some level of bad debt, like any business, but in the past those debts have been chased by a stiff letter from the school's solicitor rather than a debt collection agency.

If you didn't know, you'd never guess that alongside this quiet stretch of the river in Oxford, there's another hothouse of exotica.
Around this lily-covered pond are growing just a few of the 3,000 members of the Araceae family.
It's one which is dear to botanist Timothy Williams' heart and is the subject of Oxford Botanic garden's display at this year's Chelsea Show, despite some its members being less than sweet scented.
He says I think most people think of flowers as looking pretty and smelling beautiful.
This one looks fairly unpleasant and smells seriously revolting.
It's not a million miles removed from the inside of someone's training shoe.
Amorphophallus has several relations who are equally smelly, though this one from Columbia has a sweet, heady scent, most are quite simply pongy.
He says this one comes from Brazil, South America and the flowers are not immediately remarkable, but what's special out it is it has the most wonderful smell of red wine — actually it perhaps smells of red wine that's been in the carpet overnight rather than Chateau Lafitte.
The Araceae family also includes the world's most troublesome weed — the water-lettuce, which grows at the rate of one tonne per acre per day in the tropics and is an expensive hazard.
This plant, taro, is more welcome.
Its stem is a major source of food for 400 million people — again in the tropics.
But there's no doubt it's the smelly ones which will be attracting all the attention when they make their appearance at the Chelsea Show.
Timothy is hoping they'll be smelling their best for the start of the show next Monday.

And today his former tenant Danny Brady followed up that case with a civil action at Oxford County Court, claiming he's entitled to thousands of pounds in damages.
He was evicted from a £45-a-week bedsit in Oatlands Road, Oxford, in 1989.
Danny Brady claims he was bundled out of his room by a gang of 6 men, one of whom threatened him saying he did karate.
The court heard he was then held prisoner in the house for some 15 minutes, before managing to escape through a broken window.
Mr Brady told Judge Leo Clarke QC he hurt his knees and ankles as he ran away.
He said his possessions, including a television and video recorder, were dumped outside in the street and some property went missing.
But the landlord Ali Shan claims Mr Brady had failed to pay his rent and he was noisy, sometimes playing his music so loud neighbours complained.
The landlord insisted Mr Brady had agreed to leave of his own free will, and he was not assaulted.
The case will continue tomorrow.

A Home Office enquiry is underway tonight into an escape attempt by a prisoner who was being moved between jails.
Two guards were attacked with a razor blade and slightly injured.

The prisoner, who is serving a five year sentence for burglary was being moved from Dartmoor to Bullingdon Prison in Oxfordshire.
A category B prisoner, he was with two prison officers on a private minibus like this one — a normal method of transporting inmates between jails.
Because the bus had no radio or mobile telephone the civilian driver had to go to a nearby farmhouse to call the police.
The incident has caused great concern among officers at Bullingdon.
They believe prisoners should be moved in purpose built security vehicles, with cells to restrain prisoners.
The inquiry will seek to find out how the prisoner came to have a razor.
Tonight he's being held in solitary confinement.

Voice over
After a two-week trial at Winchester Crown Court, 44-year-old Gary Richman from Swindon was found guilty of smuggling 246 kilogrammes of cannabis resin into Britain.
Customs Offficers found the drugs hidden in a lorry load of pot plants at Sheerness Docks in January last year.
The drugs came from the Netherlands and were apparently en route to a warehouse in Bristol.
His defence had maintained that Richman was totally unaware that 3 trolleys loaded on to his lorry in Holland contained cannabis.
But after a day of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous Guilty verdict.
Richman, who used to run a shop called Europlants at Hinders Yard in Swindon, is now in custody while he awaits sentencing.
Meanwhile Customs and Excise is celebrating what it believes to be a significant blow to the drugs trade.
Under the Drugs Trafficking Act, the Judge now has to find out how much money Richman has made from drug dealing before passing sentence.
That investigation is expected to last about 4 weeks.

The TR6 was launched in 1969 as the latest in a long line of successful Triumph sportscars.
Nearly 100,000 TR6s were built over the next 7 years and 90% went to America, where it caught on as a winner on road and track.
Around 20,000 of the cars are thought to survive today, many of them suffering from serious rust problems.
But British Motor Heritage, a Rover subsidiary, says it can now halt the inevitable drive to the scrapheap.

You need extra protection when you walk through this part of the Oxfordshire countryside.
The Oxfordshire Way, which stretches 30 miles through the county, now goes through the centre of the new club house for the Oxfordshire Golf club.
Try to walk another footpath on the site, you end up with very wet feet.
Female speaker
The company have stolen the paths in the first place.
It is ridiculous to expect people to put on hard hats to walk through the countryside.
It is totally unreasonable and the company knows it and it is making a fool of the County Council, which should be prosecuting.
Voice over
Nitto Albion, an Anglo Japanese Consortium, has been granted planning permission for the golf course, but pressure groups such as the Ramblers Association objected because existing paths would have to be diverted.
So a public inquiry will be held in July.
The developers shouldn't block off the existing paths until the outcome of that, following representations from Oxfordshire County Council.
They've now agreed to build a causeway across the lake and a roof covering the path through the building site.
Male speaker
We have been asked by the County Council to do these works and as far as we are concerned we will comply with them.
Female speaker
Why did you build the lake in advance of the inquiry?
Voice over
The lake is part of our design, but at any time we will keep the lake open and that is what we are doing.
If the inquiry rules that the paths must remain, then the clubhouse may have to be pulled down.
Male speaker
If the inquiry rules that the diversions are okay, then the developer will make the diversions.
If the inquiry rules it's not okay, then the County Council would have power to ask the developers to remove the obstruction.
Female speaker
They have built the club house obstructing the highway without getting the path diverted, if they have to pull it down then they should be made to pull it down.

An air ambulance service looks set to be scrapped tomorrow.
The service has covered five counties, including Gloucestershire and Hereford and Worcester.

Now regional health chiefs have decided against funding the service themselves.
Alun Drake reports.
BARRY JOHNS/Ambulance Service
Sir JAMES ACKERS/Regional Health
MARIE MOORE/Accident Victim
The air ambulance was set up a year ago as an experiment.
Its supporters claimed the outlay of £600,000 would be justified by the extra lives saved.
The service was funded entirely by public donations.
But today health chiefs from the West Midlands region met in Birmingham to decide whether the service should become permanent, with funding from the NHS.
Outside, a small but determined lobby of supporters, including the first accident victim to be saved by the air ambulance.
But they were to be disappointed.
No regional funding was forthcoming.
Instead the 20 District Health authorities involved were asked to come up with a £9,000 each by tomorrow afternoon.
Otherwise the air ambulance experiment will be abandoned.
’ I'm not strongly encouraged at all.
I think the messages coming out today point to a cessation of the air ambulance.’
And what difference will that make to people living in the region?
’ All ambulance services try to provide the best quality care to all communities within the West Midlands region.
We genuinely believe there is a place for an air ambulance in those crucial incidents where an air ambulance could be vital.
And therefore it will now be missing.’
’ The value of an air ambulance service remains uncertain, compared with the use of that money in a different way.
For example, intensive care beds and their support is very important.
It isn't clear from the evaluation that the money is better spent on air ambulance services than it is on improving intensive care facilities.’
But for accident victims like Marie Moore from Darlaston, today's decision has come as a bitter blow.
’ They've decided to ignore everybody's opinion the people who matter most, the people it serves.’
What difference do you think the air ambulance made to your case?
’ If it happened on the 2nd of June this year, I'd die.’
Barring a last minute reprieve from the District Health Authorities, the air ambulance experiment will end at 5.00 p.m. tomorrow afternoon in Gloucester.

Two weeks after escaping from a prison in Buckinghamshire Keith Hanger is believed to have turned to murder.
In the driver's seat of this car a member of the public found the body of a man, in his 40s.
He died from a shotgun wound.
And the police say he was believed to be an associate of Keith Hanger.
The twenty nine year old was serving an eight year sentence for burglary at Grendon prison near Aylesbury.
He was due for release next year but ran off on May the 4th from a prisoners' training camp at Simonds Yat on the Gloucestershire/Herefordshire Border.
He then robbed a pub at gunpoint in Mid Wales.
And just yesterday police launched a fruitless search of Aylesbury railway station after Hanger phoned the prison to say he was in town.
A guard was also mounted outside Aylesbury police station.
Hanger has threated to kill a police officer.
But today the hunt moved from Buckinghamshire to Dorset after the body was found at a beauty spot near Christchurch.
Seventy five officers — some armed — mounted a search.
But tonight Hanger is still at large and likely to have moved again.
He says he's thought to be carrying a pump action shotgun and may now be a traveeling criminal.
The police know now Hanger was in Northampton yesterday.
He visited his brother and is believed to have taken his birth certifcate and passport.
Hanger has also threatened to kill his parents who live in Bath, and they're now under guard at a police safe house.
Tonight am MP called for a full inquiry.
He says the Governor of the prison must investigate.
Police have now appealed to Hanger to give himself up peacefully but armed police are on standby.
The police believe Hanger is driving a stolen blue Ford Cortina…registration number LLF 205V.
But they're warning he should not be approached be any members of the public.

Rail workers who feared the loss of their pensions after privatisation have been told that their money is safe.
The Transport Secretary has decided to set up a new rail pension scheme to safeguard their interests.
It comes as welcome news for around three thousand pension holders in Swindon.
March 1993/CHRIS MOORE/Reporting

For rail workers, present and retired, it raised fears of another Maxwell-style rip-off, but this time with the Government as the perceived villains.
Hundreds of workers marched on Westminster earlier this year, fearing that come privatisation, the millions in the BR pension fund would be creamed off by the new rail franchise companies.
But Transport Secretary John McGregor says the pensions are safe.
When the present scheme goes, a new joint rail industry scheme will succeed it and workers will have the right to stay in that as long as they are in the industry.
Those already retired will stay in until a new scheme specially for them is set up, but all their assets will continue to be managed by the trustees of the new joint scheme.
The Government's option 2 — taking the fund and paying index-linked pensions itself has been dropped.
It also means that workers employed by a new rail franchise company won't lose out if their franchise changes hands.

The Gloucester and Sharpness inland waterway was the first ship canal in the world.

Sandford pool in Cheltenham; at the height of summer up to 10,000 bathers a day swim and soak up the sun.
But this summer could be it's last.
The council needs to save £1m after being charge capped for overspending.
One option could be to close the pool.
He says that the council are looking at a number of options, the pool is being considered because it's very costly to run.
Sandford pool was opened in 1935 and cost the then large sum of £16,000.
Some of the money was raised by local people who contributed to special pool fundraising collections.
Harold Lock has been coming to the pool since he was a child and says it would be a crime to close it down.
He says that it just wouldn't be right to close it, it's for the people of Cheltenham.
She says that it's good to have somewhere to swim at lunchtimes.
Ron Coatman has been working at the pool for 26 years.
He says it's become part of Cheltenham's heritage.
He says that it's part of the town's heritage.
He can't imagine it being allowed to close.
The pool's official opening for this season is tommorrow, when a protest will be staged by swimmers who are raising a petition to keep the pool open.
For now the Council is looking at a number of ways to save money, if they DO decide to close the pool, these might be the only swimmers left later this summer.

When taxi driver Sabir Khan pulled up at Aylesbury railway station he thought he was picking up just another ordinary passenger.
He says he was a friendly person.
But the man who got into the front seat was Keith Hanger, an escaped prisoner wanted in connection with a murder.
A man found shot dead in this car in Dorset had been identified as Alan Kealy, according to police an associate of Hanger's.
Detectives feared he was out for revenge and armed police were put on guard at police stations.
But Hanger had already decided to go back to his prison at Grendon near Aylesbury.
At just after eight last night he was being driven through the town centre.
He even asked the taxi driver to go via an off licence.
The driver says he bought a beer.
Only after he dropped Hanger off did the driver realise who his passenger was.
He says he saw his face on the television news and knew he could have been killed.
People living near to the prison are releived Hanger is back behind bars.
And people living at Simonds Yat in Gloucestershire want to know why Hanger was allowed out of the jail to go camping.
The Forest of Dean police are also angry that they weren't warned.
And an MP wants an inquiry.
He says the police must be told in future if any prisoners are coming.
This afternoon Hanger was moved from Grendon prison and he's now being questioned by police in Dorset.

Voice over
The Russian historian from Southmoor in Oxfordshire had lost a libel action over allegations relating to Lord Aldington's role in the forced repatriation of thousands of Cossacks after the Second World War.
He had hoped to get the award cancelled because his co-defendant, Nigel Watts had reached a separate agreement with Lord Aldington.
Count Tolstoy believed the whole debt should be cancelled because of that.
This case relied on law dating back to the 1870s.
Count Tolstoy argued that he should have libel damages waived against him because the man with whom he shared the debt had reached a separate agreement with Lord Aldington.
Lord Aldington opposed this and in the end Mr Justice Morritt agreed with him.
Although the damages were shared the fact that an agreement had been reached with one of them, did not mean the debt was cancelled.
Count Tolstoy's co-defendant, Nigel Watts had said at an earlier hearing that he had never intended to push the whole debt on to the historian.
But a move to prevent Lord Aldington pursuing the action any further was dismissed.

A yacht from Gloucester with 14 people on board, named after her sponsor Nuclear Electric, headed for the line at Southampton, and the tightest finish imaginable.
Nuclear Electric was one of 10 identical yachts that set off last September to race 28,000 miles the wrong way round the world, against the winds and currents, crewed by amateurs who'd paid £15,000 apiece.
Over four stages, through the toughest conditions, the race was still wide open in April, at the start of the final leg, from Cape Town to Southampton.
Nuclear Electric had a lead of just 7 hours, then Group Four went out in front, and was still there on her own in the Channel on Saturday.
At dawn yesterday, Group Four piled on the pressure, catching the tides right and putting more distance between herself and the rest of the fleet as she approached Southampton.
Thousands had turned out to watch, and Group Four crossed the line to win the final leg.
She'd win the race overall if Nuclear Electric, back down the field and now surrounded by supporters, was more than 7 hours behind.
Her progress wasn't being helped by over-eager spectators, but after 28,000 miles Nuclear Electric crossed the line for overall victory, by just one hour and 10 minutes.
The race was the brainchild of Chay Blythe, he'd planned it for 4 years and raised the money for 10 million pound yachts.
He'd been criticised for selecting amateur crews — some said it was too tough for office workers, bakers and bank clerks.
As the crews tied up for the last time in Southampton, watched, and waited for by families and friends they hadn't seen for eight months, many of them agreed getting back to a routine, going back to work, might by tough.
The fifth yacht to arrive in the space of eight hours, Rhone Poulenc, carried a crewman who'd spoken to his family in Gloucester only once on the whole trip.
The toughest yacht race in the world will have changed the 140 people who took part, some perhaps for ever.
Done it indeed, Nuclear Electric, registered in the port of Gloucester, round the world and home victorious, by one hour and ten minutes.

Wembley says it welcomes Swindon Town, but not all Robins supporters will be able to sample its hospitality at the big match on Monday.
The national stadium has allocated Swindon 30,000 tickets for the Division One Play-Off Final, but only 20 for disabled fans.
Les Smith — who at 77 never misses a match — is one of many left bitterly disappointed.
The club thought the fairest way to decide which disabled fans went to Wembley was to hold a ballot.
Maurice Cottrell, who lives at the same nursing home as Les, was lucky enough to have his name picked out of the hat.
But Maurice, a regular campaigner on behalf of the wheelchair-bound, has every sympathy with those who missed out.
Even with a much smaller capacity than Wembley, Swindon's County Ground accommodates the same number of disabled fans.
The club's concerned about arrangements for Monday, but powerless to intervene.
Wembley hasn't ruled out the possibility of removing some seating to make way for wheelchairs.
Meanwhile there's just one consolation for Les Smith — the match will be televised live on Central.

A familiar sound in the Amazonian rainforest as the loggers bring down another mahogany tree.
It's something the Indians who live in the forest are powerless to stop:
He says they took everything.
They cleared everwhere and took everything.
But the Indians rarely profit from the mahogany trees cut from their land.
On the contrary they are being wiped out as the loggers introduce new diseases, alcohol and guns along with the roads they are driving through the rainforest.
He says most of the mahogany that's logged in Brazil is taken from Indian reserves.
The loggers build roads through the jungle to reach the trees and bring diseases which the Indians have no defences against which kill them.
If the Indians resist, the contractors shoot them.
Timbmet are Britain's second importer of tropical timber — they argue that if any of the companies they buy from are found guilty of illegal logging, they'll stop trading with them.
He says there are currently three contractors who are being prosectued but nothing has been proved against them yet.
If they are proved guilty we won't trade with them anymore.
Britain's biggest DIY chain, B and Q have already decided to stop selling Brazilian mahogany since April this year.
But for some countries trade in the wood is of direct benefit to the local people who log it.
He says in Mexico for instance there are communities who depend on it for their livelihood and who benefit from the sale of the wood.
Britain is the biggest consumer of Brazilian mahogany in the world.
It bought seventy-four per cent of the wood coming into Europe in nineteen-ninety.
The timber trade argues if there wasn't a demand by British customers for mahogany products they wouldn't sell it.

Donald and Sheila Baughan had been married for 20 years.
Their bodies were found by their 15 year old daughter, Stacey when she returned to their Marsh Gibbon home in February after babysitting.
The Buckingham Coroners Court heard how Donald Baughan had shot his wife and then turned the gun on himself.
The court heard they were both at the end of their tether.
She, because she was tired of his extra marital affairs and wanted a divorce; and he, because he was desperate that there shouldn't be a divorce.
He had just returned after a 3-day affair with another woman which had brought on the crisis.
She had demanded a divorce.
Stacey found her father, a 47-year old roofing worker, slouched in an armchair with his legs over the arm.
She said in a statement that there was a lot of blood and she went to a neighbour for help.
She didn't return to the lounge.
She added that her father kept a lot of guns in the house.
Sheila Baughan, who worked at a local school, was found holding a telephone.
She had been shot in the neck at point blank range.
Linda Baughan, Donald's sister-in-law, said he was still in love with his wife and had begged her not to divorce him.
But she had told him his affair was the last straw.
She also told the court that he'd heard he'd threatened to blow his head off.
The Coroner Mr Rodney Corner recorded verdicts of suicide on Mr Baughan and unlawful killing on his wife.

He hopes he'll win in the Courts, although he's lost in every other way.
After a year's planning and several weeks preparation, this year's Chelsea Flower Show finally opened to the public today.
All the specially laid-out gardens and stands are in place showing off the best of British gardening.
For amateurs and professionals alike, this is the horticultural event of the year.

A sea of flowers everywhere you look.
Whatever the British weather has thrown at them, flower growers up and down the country produce their best for the Chelsea Flower Show.
It's a chance for a bit of fun and the height of the gardening year; an occasion which even a beleaguered Prime Minister takes time out for.
There's a garden with a difference from the National Asthma campaign — for hayfever sufferers and asthmatics like Sir Bernard Ingham, Lady Thatcher's former press secretary.
There's no grass, just paving, no fountains to spread the pollen, and flowers with low pollen count like foxgloves and columbine.
Inside the great marquee, Mattocks roses from Nuneham Courtenay in Oxfordshire have impressed the judges with their display, winning them a gold medal — they're not quite sure, but they think it's the 20th they've won at the show.
There was another gold medal for Brackley Sweetpeas from Wingrave in Buckinghamshire.
Every year they name a new flower after a personality — this year's was television presenter Anne Gregg.
She says it's a full cream and I'm delighted to tell you it's a frilly bloomer.
I've always wanted to be a frilly bloomer!
Outside, the Chelsea Pensioner pub would have have been doing good business if it had any drinks to sell, but it was purely decorative; part of garden by Hereford Wyevale Garden Centre called the outer sanctum which won a silver-gilt medal.
He says we've had alot of people round looking at the garden and alot of the Chelsea pensioners have been looking in and at the sign above the door and saying’ Ah yes, I think I know that person!.’
A little bit of Buckinghamshire recreated at Chelsea — Harpers and Queens magazine commissioned a replica of a secret garden from Waddesdon Manor.
He says about three years ago Lord Rothschild asked us to restore the rock garden at Waddeson which had been overgrown since the 1920s.
Slowly we discovered this amazing cliff garden built in the nineteenth century in the style of marie antoinette at Waddesdon.
Just over the aisle it's the seaside, complete with botanist, David Bellamy in full flow.
Though he's more used to peering through the undergrowth, he never misses Chelsea.
He says I always comes because it's a celebration of botany and of what people can do if they believe in plants and reach into that wonderful genetic stock of plants and create all these things — that's why I come.
Garden designer, Gertrude Jekyll is looking in remarkably good shape, considering she was 150 yesterday.
The gold-winning Country Living entry celebrated her work with a nostalgic cottage-garden full of lupins, irises and climbing roses.
Another award-winning garden by the Pershore College of Horticulture based on the mythological King, Midas, who was given the power to turn everything he touched to gold; though this treasure isn't worth much — it's concrete sprayed with gold paint.
Like all the gardens here, it took several weeks to put together, but will have disappeared by the end of next weekend.
Then it's back to the drawing board to start planning for next year's show.

Fifteen thousand new-age travellers are still camped on a beauty spot in the Malvern Hills tonight, after a four-day illegal festival that has left a village under siege, and police powerless to move them on.
HARRIET RYLEY
Since the festival began, fifty people have been arrested and a police helicopter fired at with flares.
The travellers say they won't be moving on for a few days and tonight, the festival still appears to be in full swing.Local people are angry after finding drug-taking equipment dumped in gardens, and sheep savaged to death at a local farm.
The travellers say they've already started a clean-up operation and when they do go, nobody will ever know they were there.
In a minute we'll have reaction from people living near the festival site, the local MP, and police involved in trying to control the festival.
We'll also be going live to Malvern for the latest news from the scene.
But first, a look at the events of the past few days.

This was the moment when the travellers hatched their plot to invade Castlemorton Common.
Nearly 200 vehicles pulled up at the roadside on the A38 just south of Gloucester.
The travellers had already been thwarted by Gloucestershire police, who blocked entrances to a site in the Forest of Dean.
So they held a roadside meeting and decided to head for Castlemorton over the border in Worcestershire.
Soon the calls were going out to groups all over the country.
And as police looked on, the ramshackle convoy moved off.
By next morning, the normally tranquil common near Malvern, had become a travellers shanty town.
Tents had gone up and the temporary occupants were busy making themselves at home.
The 700 acre site, normally home to grazing sheep, had become a giant car park for a motley array of vehicles.
Local people were angered that the police had apparently been unable to prevent the invasion.
But the travellers who'd come to Castlemorton from all over the country, couldn't understand the local animosity towards them.
By Sunday morning, more than 20,000 travellers had turned up.
A large marquee had been erected and the camp became giant rave party.
Loud music echoed across the site, so loud that it could be heard 10 miles away.
And still more travellers arrived.
From the air the sheer scale of the invasion of the common can be seen, achieving the dubious record of being Britain's largest ever illegal rave party.
And 3 days on, it was showing no signs of coming to an end.
Well, four days on with thousands of people still on the site at Castle Morton Common, there's growing anger locally that nobody seems to have the power to do anything about the travellers.Villagers say they're under siege.
One farmer has lost twenty sheep, savaged by dogs from the campsite.
Drug-taking equipment has been found dumped in gardens, and there are growing piles of rubbish to be cleared.
The police say they're powerless.
The travellers say they'll move on, but not for a few days.Ken Goodwin reports.

The jail breakers, all remand prisoners, were among 80 prisoners being supervised by 2 officers in the exercise yard of Gloucester Prison when they escaped over a perimeter wall using a rope made of bedsheets.
The alarm was raised 20 minutes later by a passer-by who spotted the rope.
Similar escapes in the past — there've been 16 in 2 years — have prompted officials of the Prison Officers' Association to suggest video camera surveillance of the blind spot.
4 of the escaped prisoners were recaptured in Gloucester city centre within half an hour; 2 others are still on the run.
The Home Office say an enquiry is underway, but they can't discuss details of prison security.

An RAF war hero has been reunited with the resistance fighters who saved his life.
Bryn Weare was sheltered by the Belgian underground after being shot down over Germany.
Now with a group of other Britons he's cycling the fifteen hundred miles of his original escape route, to raise money for surviving resistance members.

A group of British cyclists sets off in the heart of Brussels.
They're raising money to help former Belgian resistance workers who've fallen on hard times.
And they're apparently being led by a Belgian priest.
But looks are deceptive.
The cyclist in a black cassock is Bryn Weare, an RAF war hero from Gloucester.
And the priest's garb is the disguise that fooled the Germans.
Bryn was shot down on a bombing raid in 1944 and the Belgian resistance smuggled him to safety in a coffin.
They carried him to a village outside Brussels.
Male speaker
German soldiers were outside the cemetary.
The Resistance would have put him in the grave if the Nazis had followed them.
Voice over
Bryn was disguised as a priest and issued with false documents to deceive the enemy.
He joined the resistance and hid in the schoolhouse in the village of Glabbeeck.
Now he's going through those same school gates that once opened to a 19 year old RAF aircraft engineer.
And in a moment, 48 years melt away.
Male speaker
It's hard to describe his feelings.
He spent 5 months in the house, hiding from the Germans and fighting with the Resistance.
Voice over
The Resistance fought a savage and unceasing battle against the occupying forces.
And those who collaborated with the Germans paid a heavy price.
This cafe on Glabbeeck main street was a wartime home to a family of Nazi sympathizers.
The Resistance firebombed the house and daubed swastikas on the walls in a revenge attack.
Bryn is reticent about his part in the secret war.
Male speaker
Atrocities were committed on both sides.
He doesn't like to think about them as he likes to sleep at night.
Voice over
There's very real joy and pride, as the the veterans of the resistance are reunited in Brussels.
And there's time to remember the part each played in the fight against fascism.

The Resistance risked torture and death to help allied servicemen escape.

In 1944, Bryn Weare more than repaid that debt by fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Resistance and he's proud to repay it once more in 1992.

We've followed his progress over recent years and seen him grow up, quite literally.
Metal fixators were fitted onto his leg.
They effectively stretched the bones every time the pins were turned.
It meant most of Jonathon's teenage years were spent in a wheelchair.
Now the fixators have been removed, he can fight off the frustrations of a sedentary life.

Captain Robert Nairac was kidnapped and tortured by an IRA gang in 1977 during an undercover operation in Northern Ireland.
The nation was horrified as details emerged of his ordeal at the hands of the Provisional IRA.
His parents Maurice and Barbara from Standish Court near Stroud, picked up their son's posthumous George Cross for gallantry, but couldn't lay him to rest — Captain Nairac's body was never discovered.
Now detectives in the Irish Republic are reported as saying that members of the gang that kidnapped Nairac, have offered to help them find his body in return for immunity from prosecution.
The Nairacs' MP is sceptical.
He says the family's hopes have been dashed before.

The tradition involves chasing a 9lb Double Gloucester down a steep hill, but why?
No one seems to know for sure.
He says it could be to do with common land rights or fertlity, but no one really knows.
Runners compete to win the cheese which can roll at up to 70 mph.
He says he did well last this, now he wants to win.
He says it's somthing to do and he probably will get injured.
And Gareth Smedley, who's 17, was the first casualty.
Tonight he's comfortable in hospital.
Craig, who's 16, fell in the next race, again with leg injuries.
And altogether 12 people were injured; 7 needed hospital treatment.
But for the spectators and the winners, it was all just part of the fun.
He says it could have easily been him, but they know the risk when they get ready to start.
They say it's crazy and they hope everyone's alright.
First aiders at the scene blamed the hard ground.
He says they had to deal with more serious injuries than usual and it's down to the lack of rain.
Without injuries the Cheese races just wouldn't be the same.
It's part of the tradition.
But next year a little rain would help make this craziest of sports a just little less risky.

Only a minority have been involved in that kind of talk.
The police say their softly softly approach seems to be working.
He says that he hopes they've been able to reasure the people living nearby, and that the travellers will now quietly leave.
Today environmental health officers have been inspecting the site — there are no toilets and the travellers have been using bushes as public conveniences.
He says that the travellers themselves are doing some clearing up, though some waste matter will be left behind.
The council will take care of that.
The travellers say that they ARE cleaning up — but admit that it'll be impossible to remove all the waste.
She says that they're trying to clear up the waste created by thousands of people — it's a long job and they may not have time to do it all.

Male speaker

Timbmet is the uk's second largest wood importer.

The shipment was specifically cleared through HM Customs and Excise at Tilbury docks on arrival.

However Friends of the Earth say any import of Allerce is illegal and they're horrified at the felling of the timber

This is the second oldest organism in existence.
Some Allerce trees are up to four thousand years old and a hundred and fifty foot tall and come from a very threatened environment

He didn't, he picked me up and threw me against the van and ran off.
She broke her wrist and was off work for 4 weeks.
She's still in pain.
Her attacker got a 2 month suspended sentence; the same as he got for the original theft.
Sue's boss was angry; he says it sends a clear message to criminals.
It says if you've got an opportunity of escaping, you might as well assault a policeman because it makes no difference at the end of the day.
So what if you break a wrist.
To my officers, it says why should we bother.
No spokesman for Oxford Magistrates would be interviewed, but the chairman of the bench said;.
Magistrates do treat all offences of assault on police seriously.
Each offence has to be dealt with on its merits, sometimes resulting in custodial sentences and sometimes not.
But Ralph Perry is urging the chairman to review sentencing policy.
Please talk to your colleagues and look at your sentencing policy.
There were 102 officers assaulted in Oxford last year, if you send the message that it's alright, then it will go on.
And that rate of assaults means officers in the city now have a 50% chance of being victims, like these.
The effect on morale has been devastating.
I'd still go out and do the same tomorrow, but it makes you wonder why do we really bother because we're not getting the backing we need.

2 years ago, the River Misbourne flowed freely through the village of Little Missenden in Buckinghamshire.
It was once 20ft wide and 4ft deep.
But it's now completely dried up.
The Misbourne is just one of many rivers and streams that have fallen victim to the recent drought and the increase in demand for water in the south.
Villagers blame the water company for pumping out too much.
Friends of the Earth agree; they're calling for the introduction of water meters.
The National Rivers Authority, the waterways watchdog, acknowledges that over-extraction is one of the main problems.
The water authority, 3 Valleys Water said…
We are co-operating with the NRA as far as we can.
because of our fears over water supplies, we have reduced abstraction to less than two thirds of our licence during the last 2 years, but we cannot get away from the fact that this is a severe drought which affects every underground source.
It could be years before plans to restore the River Misbourne ever come to light.

Arson has been a problem since last August.
We've had several major fires which have cost thousands of pounds.
The police have done a good job but it's very difficclt unless you catch them with a box of matches.
Now farmers are taking action by setting up Farmwatch.
It'll establish efficient links between North Oxfordshire's farmers and the police helping them to be quick off the mark if anything dubious is noticed.
If a farmer notices something suspicious, he can alert one of his co-ordinators who alerts others.
Farmwatch will also deal with the threat of travellers invading farm land and prevent scenes like those at Castlemoreton.
They've set up a pyramid hotline where a tip off is passed along the line.
Farmwatch was launched by Banbury MP and junior Environment Minister, Tony Baldry.
Clearly farmers feel if they want any help, they have to help themselves first.
I don't say this is totally going to crack rural crime but anything we can do to help ourselves to bring the numbers of criomes down, it's always going to help.
Farmers throughout the region are calling for government action on mass trespass.

Incredibly, Broadway Tower was actually lived in less than 20 years ago.
Before the site became part of a private country park the building was lived in by a local tenant farmer named Mrs Hollington.
She raised 6 children inside without the benefit of especially luxurious facilities.
Female speaker
I can't imagine for one minute what it must have been like to raise children here.
She had to wash in the shed some distance from the tower which has no bathroom facilities.
Foreign visitors can't understand it.
They always want to know why it was built, which is of course the one question I can't answer.

By anyone's standards Dick Print has had a long innings.
He started playing when he was 11 and today he chalked up 70 not out.
So he celebrated with a cricket match.
Dick's career has seen him playing against the country's best, even though he always remained a village player at heart.
(He says; I was once bowled by Frank Tyson.
Even he said it was tough ball for even the best cricketers to play)
He's opened the batting for most of his life.
He was holding a bat at his nearby Brize Norton ground at the age of 6 and was in the village side at 11.
He's played charity games against top class county opposition against Warwickshire in 1964 led by the England captain Mike Smith and against Worcestershire the following year with test players Basil D'Olivera, Don Kenyon and Tom Graveney.

The ringleaders of the gang, who were arrested at a cottage near Ross on Wye in Herefordshire, made hundreds of thousands of LSD does, hidden in fake playing cards.
They were told by the judge,’ You knew the risk you ran, you asked yourself if the game was worth the risk and you said yes it was.’
Allan Pursuitte, an American, was jailed for 12 years and ordered to be deported.
Danielle Ellison, Pursuitte's wife, was also jailed for 12 years.
Jamie Ray, another American, was jailed for 4 years and also ordered to be deported.
Michael Rock, who'd allowed his house in London to be used by the gang, was jailed for 10 years and a 76-year-old courier, George Chay, who'd brought LSD into Britain from California, was jailed for just four years because the judge said he didn't want him to die in prison.
At Worcester Crown Court, Mr Justice Mott said Pursuitte and Ellison were intelligent people who'd set up a clever, successful and profitable drugs ring.
They had added substantially to the availability of drugs in the streets of Britain.
The judge ordered all assetts of the five, amounting to £14,500, should be seized.
He said there may be more money somewhere, but he couldn't be sure.

More than 37,000 specially printed squares, concealed in Batman and Joker playing cards, and waiting to be impregnated with just one drop of LSD, were found when detectives from Herefordshire and the Metropolitan police raided the appropriately named, Lawless Cottage at Sellack near Ross on Wye in Herefordshire in January last year.
Each card holds 50 squares and each square is worth up to £10 on the streets.
It was to be the latest of four production runs over 4 years worth an estimated £20m and the most sophisticated marketing operation for LSD ever uncovered in Britain.
Detectives also found a formula for diluting LSD hidden behind a sideboard and chemical equipment under the stairs.
But a lot of the evidence which convicted the gang was found in rubbish left outside Lawless Cottage, collected by detectives instead of the bin men.
Just 15 grammes of LSD crystals, smuggled into Britain in a hollowed out book, kept the production line running; now the American Drug Enforcement Agency, the DEA, is trying to trace the lab in California which made the crystals.
The Batman and Joker playing cards, hiding the LSD squares, were kept in a safe-deposit box at Selfridges in London and the gang used the store's restaurant as a cover for drug deals, unknown to staff.
They spent their money on good food and high living.
The police have recovered only £12,000 in cash.

Just a small percentage of the original twenty thousand hippies are still camped out on Castlemorton Common in Worcestershire.
The rest have moved on, many, prompted by news that tomorrow morning, locals will apply to the courts for an order to get them evicted.
That won't come a moment too soon for farmers.
For the last six days, their lives have been completely disrupted.
Now the Government is promising to take steps to ensure this scale of invasion doesn't happen again.
Up to now the police have played a passive role with the hippies, preferring to keep a watchful eye on them.
But local councillors feel now is the time to take stronger action.
The travellers who've moved on voluntarily have been creating problems elsewhere.

5 bodies have been found but the painstaking search for 4 more has gone on all day.
He says the crash damage was very severe.
He says having been there, the crash isn't over such a wide area as we thought at first.
The Hercules plane like this one had left Lyneham yesterday afternoon with two others for low level tactical training.
9 men were on board, a 5 man crew, two experienced instructors and two engineers.
The most senior, Squadron leader, Graham Young, had years of flying to his name.
He helped Lyneham celebrate its millionth flying hour.

She says I spoke to people last night, everyone is devastated.
He says he's sorry for the families.
He says it's terrible, because the aircraft has such a good safety record.
Indeed, the last known Hercules crash was 20 years ago so questions will be asked about this low level exercise.
He says the Hercules has had 30 years service, and there are 2,000 of them.
He doubts low level flying is to blame.

Well this is the last place you'd expect to come for summer sport but it's here at Wembley on Monday that swindon town will bring their hopes and hearts…hello there…this is the stage where the fate…the future…the fortunes of Swindon Town will be decided in just one game against Leicester City…the prize a place in football's premier league…so let's go down Wembley Way to size up the Big Match…
Music…and pictures…
When you're on the road to Wembley there's always a song and a new suit…for the fans…
T shirts…flags and banners and of course a cap to top it all off…
This week the County Ground in Swindon has been open all hours…thirty six thousand tickets have been sold…goodness knows how many scarves and souvenirs…
On Monday Glen Hoddle's red and white army will march on Wembley…they've been there before…its three years to the day since they beat Sunderland but overnight promotion turned into relegation as the illegal payments scandal wrecked the club…
Some have survived to play it again…
Steve White…says he didn't expect to be going back to Wembley but now they plan to make the most of it
And the man who's made it all happen is Glenn Hoddle…for him Wembley…a big match is nothing new…or is it
Glenn Hoddle says that playing at Wembley can be like making your debut…the sight of the twin towers still gives you a buzz but they've got to forget all about that and get on and win the game…it's a wonderful place to play he says and the pitch should suit Swindon but they've got to concentrate on the job in hand
So how or why or where can Town win…the bookies have them as favourites but only just…the fans have red and white in front of their eyes…for them there can only be one result…
Vox pops with fans…who all say that Swindon will win easily
It's that kind of blind faith that forced Glenn Hoddle and his team into hiding this week…they took themselves off to Bournemouth for three days to prepare to psyche themselves up in secret
Colin Calderwood says that everywhere you go people stop and wave and that's very nice but it's been good to get away this week but now they're back in town the pressure will start to build
There's nothing between the two teams…
Swindon finished fifth Leicester sixth…on equal points…but if anything City have been a bogie team…
Town haven't beaten them for two years…
Last season Leicester lost in the play-off final…this big match has the perfect mixture…
Glen Hoddle says they're just going to play the way they always do and and the team that settles into its style…whatever it is…will win…
Brian Little the leicester manager says you shouldn't read anything into past results…
Swindon are a good side and they think they have a right to win as do Leicester…
The Swindon success story isn't just on the field…off the field they've been rebuilding too…the overdraft is below a million…but the world of football the town of Swindon still wonders if the County Ground could cope could afford the premier league…
chairman Ray Hardman says that money will be made available for Glenn Hoddle to buy players and he will wheel and deal as he usually does to get the men he wants
there are plans to develop the ground a new one point four million pound Shrivenham Road stand should be open by the start of the 94 season…about time too for many season ticket holders…the ghosts of seasons past still walk here…for Swindon only one thing matters now…that's the future…that's Wembley on Monday…that's hopefully the premier league on tuesday…
Glenn Hoddle says he thinks his team will win because there is a determination running throughout the club and the supporters who were robbed three years ago and could have gone on for another fifty or sixty years waiting a chance like this…
Music…
and you can see the whole game live on Central on Monday afternoon…don't miss it…now its a bank holiday weekend which means there's lost of sport going on here's the best of the action…
The best of british waterski-ing is on show this weekend at Kirtons Farm just off the M4…over the years we've produced 5 world records…6 world champions…8 european records…55 european champions and 21 team golds…some success story which should continue in the masters competition which takes off tomorrow and reaches the finals on sunday afternoon…
There should be a new british bike record in Oxfordshire tomorrow…
Olympic champion Chris Boardman is going for it he's riding in a twenty five mile time trial and will be setting off from Cumnor at six o clock…if you want to see him he'll be wizzing up and down the A420 and the A34…
Also getting on his bike is comedian Alexi Sayle…he's just launched the Oxfam Mountain Bike fun ride…the time is the first week in August…the place the national championships at Eastnor Park in Herefordshire

Young sailors from all over the country will be on the water at Farmoor just outside Oxford this weekend to compete in the Thames Water Youth Regatta…there's racing both days…along with trials for England and the chance to have a go in a boat or on a sailboard for the first time…all you have to do is turn up…
Its regatta day in Hereford on Monday…the local rowing club are holding their annual big event…300 crews from all over the country will be in competition…its also a qualifier for the royal regatta at henley…

On the way they've run up Ben Nevis and Snowdonia…swum across Loch Lomond and Derwent Water and cycled the rest of the way…they're hoping to raise thousands for charity and after 1200 miles have earned a few days off…
and that's it…
Wembley is empty…its quiet now but on Monday it will be full of Swindon Town fans…so lets hope they have something to shout about
