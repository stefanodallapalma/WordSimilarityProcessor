Alcohol in the Workplace
Why you need a policy to deal with it
Introduction
No one knows for certain how much the misuse of alcohol costs society, but it's a great deal.
One estimate puts the cost in terms of sickness absence alone at over £700 million a year.
The effects of alcohol misuse spill over from private life into the workplace, causing inefficiency and accidents as well as absenteeism.
This booklet gives you guidance on how to deal with the problem in the workplace.
If you tackle it along the lines suggested in this booklet, you will have taken a step towards reducing the appalling costs the problem imposes on all of us.
You may not think that you have a problem, but in a company of even modest size it is statistically likely that some employees will have a drink problem.
Whether or not you do have a problem, you need a policy.
If you are not ready to deal with the problem of alcohol misuse if and when it occurs, one day you could be faced with a crisis.
The results could be disastrous for your business and the people it employs.
This booklet isn't a blueprint for a policy, but a guide.
You know your company's needs and situation.
But whatever the size of your company and whatever business you are in, I believe it will be to your benefit to read this booklet and act upon its recommendations.

How bad is the problem?
Getting reliable figures to show how much alcohol misuse costs us, or how many people are affected, isn't easy.
What is clear is that the financial cost of alcohol misuse to society as a whole runs into hundreds of millions of pounds each year.
There's a good chance that someone affected by alcoholism works for you.
The problem isn't just with the person who has become dependent on alcohol.
Any level of drinking that adversely affects someone's work performance is likely to damage your business.
Lunchtime drinking that leads to reduced or poor quality work in the afternoons is one example.
If alcohol misuse affects your business, it could mean that you aren't as competitive as you might be.
How does it affect you?
Let's assume one of your employees drinks too much both at work and at home.
Have you stopped to consider how much he or she costs you?
What about:
•
days off sick, probably because of a hangover?
•
lateness and long hours spent in the pub at lunchtime?
•
business opportunities lost because of impaired judgement?
•
strained relationships with other staff who resent having to provide cover?
•
damage, lost production and suffering resulting from avoidable accidents?
How much does all this cost you in lost production, lost business opportunities, inefficiency?
Unless you do something about it you will be losing money — money you could have invested in new equipment, or better marketing, or taking on more employees.
Money you could have used to make your future, and that of all your employees, more secure and more prosperous.
The causes
There are many factors that can contribute to alcohol misuse.
Both the workplace environment and domestic circumstances can cause a build-up of stress which can drive people to rely on drink.
Some of the commonest factors at work are:
•
too much or too little work
•
irregular or long hours
•
pressure from colleagues
•
working alone or without supervision
•
monotony
•
under- or over-promotion
•
occupations involving access to alcohol.
And in someone's home or social life the most common factors are:
•
marital or family problems
•
family illness or bereavement
•
financial difficulties
•
social habit.
The alcohol policy
You need to have a policy on the use of alcohol.
It should cover:
•
prevention
•
recognition
•
help for individuals
•
implementation
•
monitoring.
There are some circumstances where for health and safety reasons alcohol cannot be allowed at all.
In some occupations — bus and train drivers and airline pilots, for example— employees are not allowed any alcoholic drink during the working day.
Your policy should draw a clear distinction between this sort of rule and a supportive policy to help someone with a drink problem.
Prevention
Even if you decide you don't have a problem now, it makes sense to do all you can to prevent it happening in the future.
Prevention is always more sensible and less costly than cure.
Look at the workplace environment:
•
workloads, flexibility
•
management styles
•
availability at work of low alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks
Consider:
•
setting an example yourself and making sure your managers do too
•
posters and health education booklets
•
courses and seminars.
Recognition
You should have a system for monitoring people's work performance.
Possible signs of alcohol misuse affecting someone's work are:
•
lateness and absenteeism
•
poor work and output
•
unreliability
•
bad relations with colleagues
•
impaired concentration, memory and judgement
•
accidents.
These could all be due to a number of different factors but they may be signs that someone is drinking too much.
Don't automatically assume that someone displaying one or more of them is misusing alcohol, but if the problem persists, you should certainly investigate whether alcohol is the cause.
Help for individuals
If you have employees who misuse alcohol, what should you do about it?
Turning a blind eye could cost you a great deal of money in lost orders and lost production, and it certainly won't help them or their colleagues who have to work with them.
Dismissal may look like the easiest, quickest solution.
but how much is it going to cost you to recruit and train a replacement?
And again dismissal certainly will not help them overcome their alcohol problem.
Of course, if alcohol is banned for safety reasons, dismissal may be the only option, when the circumstances have been fully investigated.
In the great majority of cases, however, you should encourage any of your employees who have an alcohol problem to seek help and treatment.
You should have a clear policy on confidentiality, on job security, on sickness benefits, on time off for treatment and on pension rights.
If time off is needed for counselling or treatment, you should do everything you can to grant it.
You should:
•
encourage employees to seek help voluntarily
•
provide advice and any other type of help needed
•
offer an opportunity for help where work has deteriorated
•
give the same protection and employment rights that you would to other employees who have problems related to other forms of ill-health
•
treat employees sympathetically if they relapse and give them another chance if they take advice and undergo treatment
But what if an employee refuses help, or drops out of a recovery programme?
In itself, this shouldn't be grounds for disciplinary action.
But unacceptable behaviour (and that includes bad timekeeping and too much sick leave) and poor work standards should be dealt with through your usual disciplinary procedures.
Implementation
Once you've worked out your policy, you should make it clear it applies to all staff, at all levels, and you should be prepared to use it fairly and consistently.
•
Designate yourself or a senior manager in your organisation to be responsible for seeing that the policy is applied reasonably and fairly.
•
Make sure managers and supervisors are familiar with the policy and procedures, and make sure too that they set a good example to the staff they supervise.
•
Make sure staff know what is expected of them — a responsible attitude towards drinking, standards of work performance and so on.
•
Make sure that your employees' representatives are involved all along the line.
That way the policy has a much greater chance of success.
•
Remember that there are many agencies who can provide advice training for key staff, assessment and counselling.
You'll find some listed under ‘Useful addresses’.
Monitoring
Once you have decided your policy and put it in place, keep an eye on how well it's working.
Have regular reviews.
Ask the staff if the policy has had any effect on their attitudes to drinking, or on their awareness of their drinking habits.
Is it having the effect you want?
If not, how can you change it?
