Welcome back:A man who executed more than thirty convicted criminals will speak at the Oxford Union tonight in favour of the death penalty.
Syd Dernley was a public hangman before the capital punishment was abolished in nineteen sixty-five.
But he says it's never lost him a night's sleep, and he'd happily take up the rope again if called.

SYD DERNLEY/Former Hangman
Voice over
The question of whether society has a right to take a life for a life is one guaranteed to raise heated debate.
That's what's expected tonight at the Oxford Union, when former hangman, Syd Dernley speaks in favour of capital punishment.
From 1949 to 1953, he took part in the execution of more than 30 people.
Even in those days there were protests, but Syd Dernley had applied for the job willingly — even keenly.
Male speaker
There's many definitions of the word kill.
I helped along people who'd been caught by the police, sentenced by the court and had their death warrant signed by the Home Secretary.
It was an interesting job.

Today though, long retired Syd still retains the trappings of his trade.
Hangmen weren't full time.
Syd worked in the Nottinghamshire coalfield and reported to prisons for duty as asked.
Executioners were proud of their speed and efficiency.
From first seeing the prisoner to the moment of death could take as little as 8 seconds and was instantaneous.
Male speaker
Have the faces of the dead ever come back to haunt you?
Have you ever lost sleep over them?
Voice over
No, never.
But I have twice dreamt of being led to the noose, the second time I got closer than the first, I hope I never have a third!
Syd is proud of his past and as his audience will find tonight, adamant it was right.
Male speaker
I'm certain.
From 1965, when hanging was abolished to 1987, thirty-??????? people have died at the hands of men who've killed before, served a prison sentence and been released.
Had they died for the first crime those thirty-???? people would still be alive today.

Four months ago Alan Govier was looking forward to early retirement, buying a new car and perhaps going on holiday.
Today he was signing on the dole.
After almost fifty years with Nuffield Press in Oxford, the last five under the ownership of Robert Maxwell, he's been told he won't see anything of his pension fund totalling around thirty-eight thousand pounds…
Alan joined Nuffield Press aged thirteen, and worked his way up to head of department.
He enjoyed being part of a friendly, thriving company, but says the atmosphere changed when Mr Maxwell took over.
Last year he decided it was time to retire and let a younger man do his job.
The publisher died three weeks later — and Alan's pension was frozen while Kevin and Ian Maxwell's alleged involvement in the scandal of the missing pension millions was investigated.
To add insult to injury, Alan's not even entitled to unemployment benefit.
A campaign group that's been set up to lobby on behalf of the thousands of people who are thought to have lost their pensions says there's lttle hope of Alan's ever being refunded…
Now Alan's enlisted the support of his local MP…
The trustees of the Nuffield Press pension fund say they're looking into Alan Govier's case.
Meanwhile he's on the lookout for another job.

42 year old Adrian Norton was suspended from his post at Stroud police station in Gloucestershire last night.
The suspension followed allegations that, while he was still on duty, he had sex with a woman in a police patrol car.
It's understood that officers in an unmarked car followed
Sergeant Norton and his female companion to Haresfield Beacon, a well known beauty spot.
Police sources say the officers were able to hear what was going on inside the car when Sergeant Norton's radio was accidentally switched on.
Investigators are thought to be in possession of a tape recording of the alleged incident.
No one was answering the door at the house in Stonehouse where Mr Norton lives with his wife and two children.
A police spokesman confirmed that the Gloucestershire Police Complaints and Discipline Department had suspended Sergeant Norton and that an internal disciplinary inquiry was pending.
In April 1990, Sergeant Norton was acquitted of the alleged rape of an 18 year old girl at Cheltenham racecourse.
Following the case at Bristol Crown Court, he was transferred from Cheltenham police station to a post in Stroud.

Few men have enjoyed a Wembley cup final day more than John Sillett.
What delight; what celebration there was when his Coventry Sky Blues sank the mighty Spurs.
And now, 5 years on, the City of Hereford is stirring to the call of the cup.
Sillett has his men marching again.
At the age of 55 he's still full of football and full of fun and possibly the best judge of what a big cup game means and brings to a club like Hereford.
Hereford's league form has fallen away in recent weeks; one win in 11.
In the dressing room player coach Greg Downs, another Wembley winner with Coventry back in 1987, has been building his men up.
If Hereford have a matchwinner, it's top scorer, Simon Brain, 10 goals this season.
He's the man United need on form; need him fit as well.
He gashed his head last Saturday, but happily is smiling again.
So the goals could come from Brain.
The masterplan has to be the manager's.
How's he going to outwit Cloughie?
And for their biggest match of the season, John Sillett who was made a club director this week has a full squad to choose from.
Everyone is fit.
What about the form United have never been further than the 4th round.
You'd put your money on Forest to win but this is the cup.
Swindon Town are another team with Wembley winners.
Manager Glenn Hoddle and midfield man Micky Hazard won the cup with Spurs.
Tomorrow they're hoping to reach round 5 by winning at Cambridge and Mickey Hazard reckons they can get to Wembley.
Here's the team news; There's a slight doubt over Paul Bodin.
He should be fit.
Swindon's glory days in the FA Cup were a long time ago while Cambridge have been to the quarter finals two years running.
Oxford's cup hopes are on ice, the cup tie with Sunderland at Manor was called off this afternoon.
It's freezing and the pitch is rock hard.
Wednesday February the 5th is the new date.
Now the formula one grand prix circus is getting ready to hit the road for another season…first race is in South Africa in five weeks time…what's new…is it going to be a head to head between Mansell and Senna…

More used to coping with exotic wild animals, Sir David Attenborough gets to grips with a pipa — an ancient Chinese instrument.
His impromptu music lesson was part of the launch of a campaign to raise £1.1m to fund the post of a curator for the music collection in the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford.
It contains over 6,000 instruments which span centuries from these paleolithic reindeer bone whistles, to the harp which belonged to Queen Victoria's Welsh harpist.
Most of them can't be played because they're so fragile and if they were restored they wouldn't make their original sound.
But the current curator, Dr. Helene la Rue does have a few she can demonstrate to visitors, like this singing bowl from Tibet…and this rain-maker from Mexico…
When the money for Dr. La Rue's post at the museum runs out later this year, there will be no-one to carry on her research and restoration work.

For me it's a celebration of people's ingenuity — all over the world and from all periods of history.

The scandal of the so-called Dianagate tape has taken a new twist.

This is the man who has conjured up fresh doubts about the validity of the so-called Dianagate tapes.
John Nelson, a communications consultant has been examining them on behalf of the Sunday Times and his conclusions are greatly at odds with the story so far.
The story goes that James Gilbey, pulled into a lay-by somewhere in Oxfordshire on New Years Eve 1989 and used his car phone to call the Royal residence at Sandringham in Norfolk.
It's claimed that Gilbey spoke to the Princess of Wales, who was using an ordinary domestic telephone.
They apparently engaged in an intimate conversation, destined to emerge in the Sun newspaper last year, as the notorious Dianagate or Squidgy tapes.
At first, it was believed that Gilbey's call, which would have gone throughn the cellnet system via this relay station at Coldash in Berkshire was intercepted by Cyril Reenan, a retired bank manager from Abingdon.
He used a scanner to listen, at random, to mobile telephone conversations.
According to Mr Reenan, he taped the call on January the 4th, 4 days after the conversation apparently took place.
Later it emerged that a second tape of the same conversation had been recorded in Oxford, on a different date, from a scanning receiver at the home of Jane Norgrove.
The finger of suspicion was pointed in the direction of GCHQ, the government's listening centre at Cheltenham, or a branch of the security services.
Intelligence experts suggested that only they would have the equipment and technical expertise to intercept and re-broadcast high quality recordings of mobile phone calls.
But according to John Nelson, the tape he examined could not have been recorded using any scanning equipment and was the result of a bug on an ordinary telephone.

The speculation has brought a renewed call for members of the Royal family to be protected from the continual scandal surrounding the tapes.

George Mayo was last seen at around 4 p.m. on Friday afternoon.
He'd just attended a pottery class at the Guild Hall in Gloucester and as usual, went to get the bus home.
But he didn't return to the Community Care house in Longlevens where he lives.
3 days on, the police say they're very worried about his safety.
This morning local volunteers and staff at the care home joined police in a search for Mr Mayo.
He's about 5 ft 2 ins tall and quite plump.
When he disappeared, he was wearing a blue knee length coat.

76 year old, Arthur Brumhill was found bludgeoned to death on the floor of this pet shop.
He'd been beaten around the head.
He was a part-time worker here for 10 years, well known as a kind, friendly man.
Neighbours are shocked at his murder.
Mr Brumhill had been working late at the shop on Wellingborough Road, something he often did.
Police say now believe the motive for the killing was robbery; a small amount of cash was taken from the till.
But they still haven't found the murder weapon.
Now they're appealing to local people for help.
A detailed forensic search of the shop began today.
Police have set up a mobile incident unit outside the shop to encourage anyone with information to talk to them.

Family and friends alike are hoping the police investigation can soon track down her husbands's killer.
A communications expert has raised suspicions that a royal residence was bugged to obtain the taped telephone conversation between the Princess of Wales and James Gilbey.
It throws into doubt the claim that the call was intercepted by a retired bank manager in Oxfordshire.

This is the man who has conjured up fresh doubts about the validity of the so-called Dianagate tapes.
John Nelson, a communications consultant has been examining them on behalf of the Sunday Times and his conclusions are greatly at odds with the story so far.
The story goes that James Gilbey, pulled into a lay-by somewhere in Oxfordshire on New Years Eve 1989 and used his car phone to call the Royal residence at Sandringham in Norfolk.
It's claimed that Gilbey spoke to the Princess of Wales, who was using an ordinary domestic telephone.
They apparently engaged in an intimate conversation, destined to emerge in the Sun newspaper last year, as the notorious Dianagate or Squidgy tapes.
At first, it was believed that Gilbey's call, which would have gone throughn the cellnet system via this relay station at Coldash in Berkshire was intercepted by Cyril Reenan, a retired bank manager from Abingdon.
He used a scanner to listen, at random, to mobile telephone conversations.
According to Mr Reenan, he taped the call on January the 4th, 4 days after the conversation apparently took place.
Later it emerged that a second tape of the same conversation had been recorded in Oxford, on a different date, from a scanning receiver at the home of Jane Norgrove.
The finger of suspicion was pointed in the direction of GCHQ, the government's listening centre at Cheltenham, or a branch of the security services.
Intelligence experts suggested that only they would have the equipment and technical expertise to intercept and re-broadcast high quality recordings of mobile phone calls.
But according to John Nelson, the tape he examined could not have been recorded using any scanning equipment and was the result of a bug on an ordinary telephone.
So if the Princess of Wales' telephone was deliberately bugged at or near Sandringham, who carried out the phone-tapping and why?
The speculation has brought a renewed call for members of the Royal family to be protected from the continual scandal surrounding the tapes.
But the latest revelations suggest that any number of culprits could be responsible for the Royal bugging, ranging from the security services, journalists and even members of the royal family.

A month ago, he feared for his sight, after 2 men jumped on him from behind, squirted superglue into his eyes and demanded cash.
The attack left Adrian temporarily blinded.
His eyelids stuck together.
Doctors were unable to operate.
He regained his sight after treatment with ointment, which eventually loosened the glue.
But following the ordeal, he's decided to quit his job.
Although Adrian's vision is back to normal, it'll be months before his eyelashes grow back.
Detectives in Cheltenham, who're still looking for the milkman's attackers, say they understand his decision.
Cheltenham Dairies have offered to keep a place open for Adrian, if he changes his mind.
But Adrian says he won't return.
He just hopes his family will get by, until he finds a new job.

Welcome back:The people who look after the Malvern Hills have been accused of being secretive and undemocratic.
The local council is considering complaining to Parliament about the body known as the Malvern Conservators.
They want them to be more answerable to public opinion.

Cllr PAT MERRICK/Ex-Conservator
ROGER HALL-JONES/Conservators Chairman
LIZ GRIFFIN/Editor/Malvern Gazette
The Malvern Hills have been looked after by the Conservators for around one hundred and ten years.Now they're asking Parliament for more powers.And it's that request which has led to controversy.
Objectors say the Conservators must be brought to heel and made more responsive to public opinion.
This morning those objectors were not slow to voice their opinions.
’ The way they operate in such secrecy gets me.
Why should a public body operate in a secret way.
What have they got to hide.
They're supposed to be serving all of us.’
’ The trouble is they're not accountable.
If they do anything which affects anybody, your only recourse is to take them to a High Court for a judicial review.’
Roy Hart's main complaint is that he has to leave his car in a small car park and walk home because the Conservators won't let him take his car up to his house.
In fact, he says he needs written permission a week in advance before delivery lorries can get to his home.
That includes coal for fuel, and building materials when he renovated his home.
’ It wouldn't be an overstatement to say we've carried near on a hundred tons of material of one sort or another up this driveway to our house, whereas it could have been done in a couple of days with permission to drive up.’
Pat Merrick is chairman of the local council.Until recently she was also a Conservator.But then she resigned.
’ I have become increasingly frustrated with various comments made, and the autocratic way in which decisions are made, and the secrecy — the fact that all the committee meetings that are actually doing the work are held in secret.’
But the conservators say that since their membership is made up of people nominated by local councils, it's wrong to say they're undemocratic.
And they deny all other complaints as well.
’ I do not accept those criticisms.I think the conservators have done a very good job over one hundred and ten years.
We're one of the oldest conservation bodies in the country.
Many of your listeners will know the Malvern Hills, and had resort to them And the fact that they can come and enjoy them today is through the dedication of board members over a hundred and ten years.’
The row's been closely followed in the local paper.
’ We can't attend their committee meetings which is where all the real decisions are made, and we can't get information about what goes on in a committee meeting.
So it is very hard.’
The local council is meeting about now to decide whether or not to petition Parliament about the Conservators request for more powers.

The Bishop of Gloucester, the right reverend Peter Ball, has been on rest leave since he was first interviewed by police in December.
It's understood that allegations of indecency were made by a 17 year old trainee monk in Brixton.
The Bishop, who only took up the post last march, was advised by the Archbishop of Canterbury to take a rest from his official duties.
The bishop has not been charged, but has been on police bail since the investigation began.
That bail has just been extended — because, say the police, enquiries are taking longer than expected.
Once those enquiries are complete, a file will be forewarded to the director of public prosecutions in london, where a decision will be taken on wether the Bishop is to be charged and prosecuted.
The Government has gone back to the Appeal COurt tonight in a second attempt to stop Central Television screening the first filmed interview with mass murderer Dennis Nilsen.
The Home Office tried to ban the interview on the grounds it might cause distress to relatives of Nilsen's victims.
The High court ruled that the documentary Murder in Mind was in the public interest, but within hours, an appeal was launched.
Alison Mackenzie reports.
MIKE MORLEY/Central Producer
Dennis Nilsen is one of Britain's most notorious mass killers.
Jailed for life in 1983 for six murders he claimed to have killed at least ten other young men mutilating the bodies and dumping their remains in and around his home in North London.
His is a number of interviews with serial killers used in an hour long documentary Murder in Mind which examines new police methods of catching them.
Mike Morley seen here leaving the high Court recorded the interview between Nilsen and a top psychologist at Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight last September.
But in court the Judge Mr Justice Aldous heard claims from the Home Office that broadcasting the interview would distress relatives and friends of the young men who were murdered.
But after deliberation the Home Office request for a ban was rejected.
The court ruled the interview could be shown.
It would have an educational benefit and bring home in a dramtic way the frightening nature of serial killers.
After the hearing Mike Morley said he was pleased with the judge's decision.
Mike Morley says we're obviously delighted with that decision.
The public has a right to see this interview.
It shows how serial killers don't have two heads.
For much of their lives they act and behave as normal people.
During the hearing the Home Office claimed Mike Morley had tricked his way into the prison to record the interview with Nilsen.
But Mike Morley refuted that claim.
Mike Morley says I have always refuted that allegation and I still do.
I arrived at Albany accompanied by two senior police officers and a psychologist.
There was no way anyone could mistake me for anyone other than a journalist.
The Home office has invented that story to cover up their own cock up.
The Home Office have now taken their case to the court of appeal.
A decision is expected later.

The drive from Alison McLean's Didcot home to work is relatively short, but it brings back terrifying memories.
It's only 3 months since her car was written off in an accident on the A34 in Oxfordshire; an accident in which she was lucky to escape with her life.
In heavy fog she collided with a lorry.
Her Metro spun across the carriageway, hit the crash barrier and ended up in the southbound lane, just avoiding a head on collision with on-coming traffic.
She was cleared of blame, so was stunned when she received a letter from the local authority requesting payment for repairs to the crash barrier.
The letter, from Oxfordshire County Council's engineering department, said:’ I understand you are the owner of the vehicle involved and therefore must inform you that the council holds you responsible for the costs of repairs arising from this incident.’
Alison believes the letter should have been sent to the person who caused the crash and the local authority should have made every effort to see this was done.
Today a spokesman for the council said the letter was part of a standard procedure.
Alison escaped with only aches and pains from an accident which could easily have claimed her life…now she hopes she can put all the anxiety of the past few months behind her.

Extra officers have been drafted in from headquarters to carry out house to house inquiries.
Police now believe up to nine serious crimes may be linked.
They've re-opened an incident room they set up in November when a fourteen year old girl was raped.
That inquiry led to an arrest for four sex offences but police believe another man is responsioble for the rape of the schoolgirl, four indecent assaults, as well as robberies and the latest attack.
All the offences happened on or near the same two footbridges on the Fishermead estate.
Now local residents are anxious.
It's thought the attacker is white, five feet 8, and slim with a London accent.
Meanwhile, a reward of two thousand pounds has been offered for information.

Paula Hamilton is renowned as the actress in the Volkswagen commercial, who storms out of the house and throws away expensive gifts from her lover, except of course the keys to a new car.
Now she'll have to put her own car keys aside for three weeks, after being banned from driving by Witney magistrates.
The court heard she was charged with driving her Bentley on the A-40 at Curbridge near Witney last year at 99 mph.
Just 13 minutes later, she was spotted again near the village of Asthall, doing 90 mph.
She was stopped by a police patrol car.
The incidents happened last August.
The case had already been adjourned earlier this month because Miss Hamilton's driving licence had been stolen and there was a delay in getting a copy.

A college in Worcester is celebrating more than one hundred and twenty five years at the top.

But as Elizabeth O'Reilly reports, the pupils there have a more difficult task than most.

Games are an integral part of any school's curriculum and the same can be said for New College, but all the pupils are blind or have got very little sight.
The football's got ball bearings in it.
It's all part of the schools' ethos — don't let blindness get in your way.
’ The children treat blindness a bit like hayfever, it's an inconvenience.
A very dull topic.
If it's talked about at all it's usually the subject of sarcastic humour.’
’ OK we're blind.
I mean we can walk, we can talk the only thing we can't do is see.
That's not going to stop us leading a normal life.’
Learning to be independent is also a large part of the education at New College.
The small number of pupils at the boarding school, just 125, means class sizes are limited to a maximum of 10.
Academic results are high and most go on to further education.
’ Everybody in the sixth form is aiming for higher education of one sort or another, it's just as academic as anywhere else really.
Everything here at the college is geared up for those with no sight, or very little, which really does help because it prepares you for University training really, where they aren't geared up for you.
But here we've got the equipment and you can get the knowledge to learn and go on to university and learn it yourself really.’
The Royal National Institute for the Blind has been educating and caring for blind people for one hundred and 25 years.
The charity says New College uses the most up to date technology to help youngsters learn to cope in everday situations.
A talking weighing machine says '55 grammes.'
’ My parents know and I know that this is the best place I could be.
It's an absolutely brilliant place I'll probably get to Cambridge or Oxford or somewhere nice.’
Ambition is encouraged at New College.
But life skills are just as important here as A-levels.
It's the combination of academic and social learning that will help the pupils survive and compete in the seeing world.

Even the return of Hoddle, Ling and MacLaren wasn't enough to revitalise a flagging Swindon side.
The first goal went to Grimsby's Tony Rees, who left Swindon helpless with a curling drive from the edge of the box.
After the break it was Swindon's turn, a back heel from Hazard, a perfect pass from Hoddle, a smart ball from Maskell and Paul Bodin took the glory.
Not for long though, as Grimsby sliced through Swindon's defence.
Digby's touch wasn't enough.
And Paul Groves scored through the resulting scramble.
The final result; Grimbsy Town 2 — Swindon 1.
In the wet West Midlands, promotion chasers Walsall were probably surprised by Hereford's mini revival in recent games, unbeaten for the last 4.

Even in rehearsal it requires stamina and dedication to make it appear so smooth.

It's a major coup for the Thamesdown Dance Studios to have the finances to generate a new dance professional dance company outside London.
They hope it will encourage more people to take up dance.
Marie McCluskey, who runs the Thamesdown Dance Centre, says people of any age can take up dance.

Murder in Mind explored the technique of offender profiling and featured filmed interviews with serial killers across the world, including Denis Nilsen.
Nilsen gained notoriety a decade ago at the so-called house of horror in North London.
He murdered at least a dozen young men before burying their bodies in and around his home.
Despite Home Office objections the Court of Appeal ruled that the programme should go ahead.
But the Scottish family of one victim were distraught.

Nilsen picked up young men in London before bringing them to his home.
One went to bed at the house…and awoke to find himself first being strangled, then taken to a bath.

Hundreds of buyers turn up to take their pick of the best of the County breed.
Today, 66 bulls and 9 heifers were being sold by farmers from all over Britain.
Male speaker
It's the most important sale in the Hereford cattle calendar.
Buyers used to come from all over the world until the export ban.

They were part of a prize-winning herd of more than 80 cattle which was founded 5 years ago.
Dynasty, a giant Canadian Hereford weighing over a ton was imported to sire larger bulls to compete with the heavier continental breeds.

Motoring organisations like the AA agree that drivers take too many risks.
But overhead lighting could help eliminate some of the dangers.
Those who use the motorway regularly like lorry drivers tend to stop off during foggy periods.
They have mixed views about the benefit of lights when driving in fog.
More bouts of fog are expected later this week.
The advice to drivers is to slow down and take heed of the warning signals.

This replica handgun, complete with blank cartridges and this airpistol were taken from 3 youths after a father complained to police that his family had been fired at from a car, as they drove down Barton Street in Tewkesbury.
The man, who doesn't wish to be identified, says that he saw flashes as from the gun and thought his family were being fired upon.
He says that the car kept going — then three other flashes were seen — everyone was very frightened.
It's not illegal to buy or own replica guns, a flick through any gun magazine reveals how easy it is to get hold of one.
But some gun dealers have stopped selling replicas, because they're worried about them falling into the wrong hands.
He says they stopped selling replica handguns because he suspected that some of his customers wanted them for possible criminal reasons.
Mr Meadows says there could be a way of allowing legitimate collectors access to replica guns.
He says that replica guns should be subject to a form of licence — rather like shotguns and firearms are.
The police say they're considering charges against the 3 youths, but add that the youths now realise how foolish they were to fire the replica in the street and are deeply sorry for frightening the family.

At Springhill open prison near Aylesbury, Murray Stewart was just another inmate.
7 weeks ago on December 5th, he walked free.
There was no massive police hunt; no warning to ports and airports.
Yet Murray Stewart, formerly known as Murray Reilly, was serving a 5 year sentence for attempting to defraud British Aerospace of £40m.
In his native Australia, he was the country's most wanted man, photographed with American mafia bosses and hitmen.
He was named in successive Royal Commissions on organised crime in the 1970s.
He's been jailed for firearms, fraud and passport offences and caught smuggling 4 tons of cannabis into Australia.
After his conviction Stewart was sent to two secure prisons before Springhill…including Horfield in Bristol…where he was assessed and downgraded as being of a low risk.
Staff there standby their decision to send him to Springhill
But in Australia Stewart's lowly catagorisation is being seen in a more sinister light
To add to Home Office embarrassment over the Stewart affair…
Thames Valley Police failed to seal off ports and airports when he walked out.
The mistake meant his absence wasn't entered into the police national computer until a couple of days ago.
A spokesman said this afternoon’ There has been an error by Thames Valley Police.
A full investigation has been started.
It will get to the bottom of what went wrong.’
In the last hour they've added,’ there was a delay in putting information on the computer records.
The circumstances are being reviewed.’
The Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, says everything possible is being done for a twenty eight year old man who's spent thirteen months in an Indian jail.

In court, the 47 year old father of two has admitted 3 specimen charges of indecent assault.
When the case was first heard last week, the judge, Harold Wilson wanted to know why police weren't called in in 1990 when Social services first knew of the abuse.
In fact, it was a further 2 years before police inquiries began.
In court today the prosecution referred to a report prepared by Social services.
The man had gone to the local authority to get a letter stating he was fit to have custody of children.
He admitted fondling his ex-girlfriend's daughter, but Social services assumed it had accurred 5 years before and his own children weren't in danger.
They checked at the girl's school and whether the man was known to police.
The prosecution said Social services accepted that they should have interviewed the girl and her mother and liaised with police.
The court heard the girl has made several suicide attempts and is still receiving treatment.
The man was given a 2 year probation order on condition he attends a clinic.

The city of Worcester witnessed the beginning and the end of the bloody revolution which was to change so much.
Today the Royalists were back in Worcester…to escort the present mayor to London…he's been invited to take part in the civil war anniversary celebrations at the palace of Westminster.
The mayor, councillor Ray Turner says:’ When the king, that's Charles the second, was proclaimed King in Scotland, he made his way south trying to raise an army and he was turned away from everywhere until he came to Worcester and the mayor there proclaimed him king of England and in recognition the king knighted the mayor and he rode with the king around the city to raise an army.’
The manager of the Commandery Centre, Richard Townsley says:’ Worcester was a very important city geographically, it was situated on the roads across to Wales, down to Oxford and into London.
It was an important river crossing for the Severn.
At the end of the war the last battle was fought here, Charles the second came with a scottish army and had the final battle with Oliver Cromwell.
The guild hall has a statue of Charles the first, Charles the second and Queen Anne over the top.
The story goes there's a little carved head which is nailed by the ears to the door and everyone here says that's Oliver Cromwell.’

The Oxford-based charity Oxfam made more than a quarter of a million pounds last year from second-hand and home-made toys.
But they're having to withdraw them all by next week because of a change in European safety regulations.
The new rules say that all toys made after January 1990 must carry a European safety tag.
Shops selling second-hand toys that don't carry the CE mark, must be able to prove they were made before then.
Oxfam says that's impossible, so they'll have to withdraw all their toys.
Female speaker
I understand the reasoning for it; to make sure that all toys sold are safe.
But it doesn't really allow for second-hand toys.
We're going to have a period, before toys start coming in with the EC label, when we've a gap with very little to sell.
Voice over
Oxfam says it's unlikely they'll even be able to sell toys that originally had a CE mark.
Female speaker
The grey area comes in that it's much easier for manufacturers to put the CE label on the packaging.
So when the packaging comes off, the CE code is gone.
Once they come to us the packaging has disappeared and so we can't sell it.

Female speaker

We have to apply the legislation both to Oxfam and to other high street shops.
Although they are a charity, they trade the same way as other high street shops.

The new legislation applies to all charitable shops.
Unless the EC decides to treat them as a special case, it seems the only way out for them will be to give the toys away.

Murray Stewart was jailed in the summer for attempting a £40m computer fraud.
Formerly Australia's most wanted man, he walked out of Springhill Open prison near Aylesbury 7 weeks ago and hasn't been seen since, giving rise to questions about how he was sent to low-security confinement in the first place.
Stewart's chequered career began on the other side of the law in Sydney Australia where he was a police officer…he was even decorated for outstanding bravery in the course of duty.
Stewart became still more of a national hero when he represented Australia at rowing in the Melbourne Olympics.
But by the time he was assessed as fit for open prison in Britain he'd become the leading figure in Australia's organised crime world…involved in drug smuggling…fraud and firearms offences
Murray's apparently effortless escape has caused fury in Australia where there have been claims he must have bribed his way to a low security catagorization
Mr Pilling says there will be an investigation into how Murray came to be sent to Springhill in the first place.
Meanwhile he's still at large 
A man has been convicted of causing suffering to thirty eight pets in his tiny terraced house.

It can be a lonely, isolated life on a farm and a whole day often passes without meeting or talking to anyone.
Add to that the worsening recession in agriculture and you have a recipe for depression that all too often can lead to suicide.
As a result, farmers are twice as likely to kill themselves as other members of the community.
Today the Samaritans and Citizens Advice bureaus in Herefordshire launched a campaign to tell farmers they can get help to cope with their problems.
Samaritans in Hereford have noticed a growing number of farmers ringing in for counselling:
The Citizens Advice Bureaus will also play a key role:

It's given to people in the last years of this century who will make a difference to the plant in the next century.
Despite suffering from Motor Neurone disease, he's compiled valuable information to help conserve the forest and halt it's destruction.
He shares the thirty thousand pound prize with Liz Hosken, who has done pioneering work alongside those who live and work in the rainforests.
The judges look for courage and initiative.
Polar explorer Robert Swan said he was humbled by Michael's example.
With trained helpers at home in Oxford, Michael has put together valuable information on almost a thousand species of trees.

Today the painting is worth forty thousand pounds, and takes pride of place in the new Summerfield gallery at cheltenham art gallery and museum.
The gallery was officially opened by arts minister Timothy Renton.
He says that the Gallery reflects the style and taste of Cheltenham, and is very exciting for the town.
Ron Summerfield's antiques collection was, by any standards, enormous.
Forteen thousand items were sold during a series of auctions over twenty five days.
It was the largest auction sale of a single collector held this century, and made seven million pounds.
This has been put into a trust, and is being used to help the elderly and for the arts — seventy thousand pounds was donated for the Summerfield galleries in cheltenham, which also contain some objects from the collection.
He says that before he died Mr Summerfield had said he'd like his money to be used for a charitable trust — the gallery is just what he would have wanted.
He says that Mr Summerfield would be bemused by all the fuss — but would appreciate the way his money had been used.
There were few people who knew Ronald Summerfield really well.
One of them was the lady with him in this picture, Bessie Yendley, who became his fiance.
She often witnessed his eccentricity in full flow at the customers who came into his antiques shop.
She says a customer once asked Mr Summerfield how he managed to stock-take when his shop was in such a mess?
He chased the customer down the road and told him never to come in the shop again — that was the way Ron was!
Few people who met Ron Summerfield will forget him.
Now, with the opening of the summerfield galleries, his name is sure to live on in cheltenham for years to come.

It's a freezing cold foggy morning, but that doesn't keep Wildlife artist, John Cooksley from his work.
Thousands of swans, ducks and geese spend the winter at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust at Slimbridge, giving the artist the perfect chance to select subjects to paint.
The first stage is to capture some of the birds on film:
He says that he's looking for birds preening or doing something which makes a good composition.
Then Mr Cooksley uses the slides as a reference while he paints.
Purists might argue he should've been out in the colds using his sketchbook, instead of a camera, but he disagrees.
He says he can capture far more detail on slides than he could by sketching.
John Cooksley is a former teacher who gave it all up to become a fulltime Wildlife artist.
Then he was offered the chance to be artist in residence at Slimbridge and jumped at the chance to stage his own exhibition.
He says that he's always wanted to work as an artist at Slimbridge — it's a lifetimes dream come true.
But the teacher in John still comes out whenever some of the many schoolchildren who visit the centre see him at work:
He says he saw a duck diving underwater — it went Zoooom!
John Cooksley's exhibition at Slimbridge ends on Sunday, but he says he hopes to stage another in the summer.
Workers at a department store have had their pensions frozen because money was taken out of the fund before the shop was sold to new owners.

Workers at the Lewis's chain store in Oxford were learning tonight of the threat to their pension fund.
Last year they faced uncertainty over their jobs when the Lewis's group went bust and called in the receivers.
Now their pension money has been frozen while trustees investigate certain deals made using money from the fund.
It's led to calls for immediate action to protect workers'interests.
The Lewis's chain is now run by the Owen Owen group.
More than thirteen hundred employees are affected by the action.
They're currently unable to transfer their money to another fund or take early retirement.
It comes in the wake of the Maxwell Pension Fund scandal, which left many Maxwell employees in Oxford without thousands of pounds due to them.
Union officials say a change in the law is urgently needed.
Tonight workers themselves were stunned by the news.
The Law Debenture Trust has been called in as independent pension trustees.
The firm is dealing with both the Lewis's and Maxwell funds.
The Trust says existing pensioners will continue to be paid, but the rest of the money has been frozen.
They are invesitigating the two transactions in question, to see if there has been a breach of trust.
They will take action, through the courts if necessary, to recover the money.

Cracks up to half an inch thick are the unmistakeable signs of subsidence.
It's causing a blight in many areas acrss the region, where the soil is mainly clay.
In Swindon, a council report suggests the problem has risen twelvefold in recent years.

I was absolutely devastated.
There were cracks right down the wall and right across the top step and down the bottom wall as well.

Voice over
The unusual drought conditions of the last 3 years are being blamed for the subsidence.
In areas of clay, like Swindon and parts of Gloucestershire, the ground has shrunk, causing serious damage to buildings.
The National Rivers Authority says rainfall levels have been unusually low.
Male speaker
The last three years have had below average rainfall.
It's been the driest period since the 1930s.
This is the sort of event which happens once every 50 years on average.
Voice over
The cost of subsidence to house owners and local authorities is reflected in the level of claims paid out by insurance companies.
In 1975, subsidence cost insurers £5m.
By 1989, the figure was £255m.
In 1990, it almost doubled.
And last year, insurers expect the final cost to be as much as a billion pounds.
Male speaker
It's a huge problem.
What the insurance companies have been trying to do is make things fairer for the policy holders, by charging householders extra premiums where the risk of subsidence is higher.

They were too unstable to be transported.
The ammunition was only inches beneath the ground, which alarmed the farm manager.

The question remains: how they they get there?
RAF Little Rissington was the base for the Central Flying School during the war.

Doctors spotted a lazy heartbeat.
Then very shortly after her birth on New Year's Day it was realised she had a heart problem.
The vital veins from her lungs — the pulmonary veins — weren't draining in to her heart, but into a chamber which bypassed it and sent blood down to the liver instead.
Top surgeons at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford had to cut away the chamber and attach the veins to the heart.
A rare operation especially in one so young.

There are risks because of the operation and also the size of the child and the time we have to do it, so soon after birth.
